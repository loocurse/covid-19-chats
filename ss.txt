[4/8/17, 10:43:37 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Anw leaders, as y'all prep for CG (and go about many other things) wanna encourage you to spend time with Jesus 😊 not to squeeze a CGM or message out but to spend time with Him and talk to Him, the way you would talk to a friend.. don't just know about Him, *know Him*! and I know things in your heart will be settled, you'll be restful, things outside will be aligned, and His shalom and wholeness can't help but rub off on you 😊 enjoy Him! 

(Popped out for a while just to send this to y'all hahha 🙆🏻 have a blessed day!)

Declaring that as the youths take time off their studies and spend time with Jesus that they would not return the same way!! May You prepare each heart to be fertile ground for the Word to go forth and take root in their lives 🙂🙂 in jesus name amen!!

4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: *then I restored that which I took not away.*



Hey guys I was just listening to this amazing sermon by Pastor Prince 2-3 weeks ago and he talked about how God's miracle working power(Dunamis) is made perfect in our weaknesses. And then he goes on to Psalms 69 which is a *Messianic psalm, in other words a psalm about Jesus*. And here in verse 4, it says that *Jesus restored what he did not take away.*

And I was thinking yeah, wow thats amazing, Jesus came to restore to us what other people had taken away from us and with accordance to the Jewish law, a 120%! And thats amazing like whatever wrong someone has done to us right? *Like we don't need to look to the culprit for payback anymore*. If a person has slandered you, Jesus takes his place to restore you. If someone has hurt you, emotionally or physically, *Jesus has taken the person's place to restore you*. Because Jesus came to restore what He did not take away!

And then I thought about my own weaknesses, my own fears, my own insecurities and *I just realised that this didn't just extend to people who hurt me. This also includes the things I have robbed myself of*. Maybe my own fear has caused me much anxiety and needless thoughts, Jesus is here to restore peace at a 120% to a worry He did not cause. Maybe that anxiety has caused me to overthink and destroy or negatively affect some of my relationships, Jesus restores a 120% of what the anxiety, caused by my own fear, has taken away. And I was like wow....

Truly His strength is made Perfect in my weakness man.

[12/8/17, 12:23:57 PM] Loocurse ARROW: What should a CG be like? 

PEEL

*Purposeful*

Some kind of objective at the end of the CG. Be intentional even if it's rubbish

*Edifying*

Not just hanging out. Try to include word or encouragement. 

*Engaging*

This is youth ministry, not Chinese ministry... 

*Love*

Let everything you do be done in love by first receiving the love that Jesus gave us.
[12/8/17, 12:25:34 PM] Loocurse ARROW: 3 questions to find out what to share. 

1. What are you feeding on? 

2. What are your youths going through? 

3. What is the vision for the CG?

[13/8/17, 11:56:39 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Hi guys this is a short but auper crazy testimony. If the SA leaders can remember I legit sprained my shoulder while trying to slap a fly when in olive vine. So while it didnt obstruct me alot like it had pain la. Then right I just decided to play Pastor Prince's sermon "Amazing things happen when you flow in the Spirit" to just sleep. Then at the 16 mins mark right, he suddenly talked about pain from your left shoulder and how it was being healed. I realised that it was my left shoulder that sprained. And IMMEDIATELY I sat up and started to look for the pain.... AND THERE WAS NONE LIKE WHAT?!?!?!?! JESUS IS SO GOOD LIKE TRULY HE TRANSCENDS TIME AND SPACE?!?!?!? It was suuuuper cray and I just had to share it to give glory to God. Okay thanks for reading gnite guys 😁

[1/9/17, 5:04:56 PM] Kylie ARROW : But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard of our plan, they scoffed contemptuously. “What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” they asked.
- Nehemiah 2:19

Hello a little late but gna share what stuck with me from our bible study sesh on weds cos this was literally what just encouraged me as I was planning for a project for one of my modules.

So in this verse it shows how the enemies looked down on Nehemiah and even questioned his intentions when Nehemiah shared about the vision that was put on his heart to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. 

The enemy will question your motives and intentions in ministry or even when you just want to do something good e.g.
"Are you just engaging your youths just to boost your ego/prove that you are a gr8 leader"
"Are you just doing spending more time with them so that they will like you more"
"Are you kissing up to the tutor so that you'll get better grades?"
etc
etc
LIES
LIESSSS
LIEESSSSSS

so ya the verse was encouraging for me cos sometimes we second guess our own intentions and that holds us back from acting on what the Lord may moved in our hearts to do. so yaaaas don't be fooled by his liessss. LIEESSS.

[12/9/17, 1:02:50 AM] Abel Khoo: Yes, all please read, can we discuss on *thurs*?
We'll have breakout and the breakout will go along the lines of what's mentioned in the CGM. 
- Getting them to share an area that they want to see the Lord work in 
- How does the principle of the tithe work in that area? 

Please think of examples in your own life :) and be ready to share when we discuss :)
[12/9/17, 1:03:38 AM] Kylie ARROW : My FYP skype meeting is every thurs night.
[12/9/17, 1:06:01 AM] Abel Khoo: Also, let's be a leadership that runs with what pastor preaches on Sunday:) I was really blessed the sermon yesterday. 

_Shall we, pray 22 mins for the coming days leading up to cluster ? _
Believing that we will see a a record number of youths come this Saturday:)
[12/9/17, 9:00:53 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Amen!
[12/9/17, 9:01:10 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Is friday night too late?
[12/9/17, 9:18:10 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Hello guys! Here's the proposed timeline for cluster.

1510 - 1515 Welcome to cluster!
1515 - 1525 Worship
1525 - 1530 Exhortations
1530 - 1535 Holy Comm
1535 - 1600 Sharing
1600 - 1630 Breakout
1630 - 1645 Closing sharing
1645 - 1700 Closing prayer

Worship - Kaijie
Exhortation - Ryan
Sharing - Kylie + Abel
Holy comm - Megan
Video + Sound - Berwin

*Concerns*

1. I'm asking Abel if we have time for two youths, one from each school, to have a 77 seconds sharing

2. Looking at the CGM, it is possible to bring holy comm into the sharing. Shall we have holy comm after the sharing before breakout?

3. I need a time keeper! Does anyone want their rice bowl and volunteer?

[14/9/17, 9:43:36 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Got you covered with the recording brother
[14/9/17, 9:46:36 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okay thanks. Can we never support Skype again?
‎[14/9/17, 9:56:30 PM] HFRyan ARROW: ‎audio omitted
[14/9/17, 10:00:58 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Hey guys so after you listen to the record basically, the objectives of the breakout facilitation is:

1. *To open the youth's perspective on tithing*, that its not just about money, but rather *you can tithe emotions and time as well*. The 10% that you give will make the rest sanctified.

2. *To equip them with practical handles* on how to tithe their emotions and time i.e P&W and praying in the spirit for time and Telling the Lord first instead of your friends or family about whatever you're going thru, be it pain, anger, sadness or even happiness
[14/9/17, 10:04:39 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Also after hearing the recordind please note that it would be good if everyone could helm facilitation.
[14/9/17, 10:05:16 PM] HFRyan ARROW: So everyone do think of the questions you are going to use to guide the sharing and *share them here by tmr night*

[16/9/17, 9:23:26 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Haha lucas is with his girlfriend
[16/9/17, 9:23:31 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Not with a boyfriend 😂😂😂
[16/9/17, 9:23:41 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Unless 🤔
[16/9/17, 10:20:16 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Gg.com
[16/9/17, 10:53:01 PM] Kylie ARROW : *What was good*
- Worship was good - partly cos of synergy also since they're a couple.
- Setting the atmosphere/pace at the start with prayer really made a positive difference (remember we were talking about how one of the cluster sesh we had when worship fell short because they caught on the fast pace at the the start and it affected them? This time round when lu prayed it was good and worship was good)

*What can be improved*
- CGM (tbh I couldn't buy in to the tithing emotion/time thing cos of the strict definition of tithing from the bible, it rly felt like a stretch for me so prepping the sharing & breakout was quite difficult BUT OK I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED EARLIER ALSO. In the end if you look at it from firstfruirs perspective ok then I can understand) 
- Keeping to time (on my part for sharing)
- Lyrics slides. Our room is a weird room so no matter where the worship team stands part of the screen will still be blocked but still it would be better for the lyrics to be like 2-3 lines at the top of the screen rather than in the middle, song title no need so big on top also mb can put at the corner.
- Comms as a team about breakout. Think we need to learn to voice out and clarify if we are not clear about anything if not like today some people prepped the breakout to explain tithing again which abel covered in his sharing. So if we weren't clear it would have been good to voice out.
- Sharing slides/verses could have been sent to the entire group so every one would know what would be covered in the sharing but it's also on our part to prep earlier also la heh 🙈

*Personal takeaway*
- I finally understand the principle of committing your first fruits in terms of emotions/time to the Lord lel. Using the word tithe rly confused me cos of how the bible strictly defines tithe. 
- this team has come rly far ???!?!?! would never have dreamt for cluster to run like that 2 years ago?
[16/9/17, 10:54:28 PM] Kylie ARROW : Btw if got feedback for me pls give 🙏🏼 lu was telling me about using too much fillers. And also the envelope part too HAHAHAHA jialat
[17/9/17, 12:15:48 PM] Abel Khoo: Btw guys:) here's a reminder to send me the names of your worship people by *19 Sept*!!!! 
Here's a refresher in case you forgot:
Sean Goh is looking for more JC/POLITE youths who can serve as BVs
- Will provide training and streamlined nomination process
- Youths could be those who are already serving in their clusters/CGs, who are regular and tithe with envelope.

Thanks guys:))
[17/9/17, 12:16:11 PM] Abel Khoo: @6598712012 @6597836744  can y'all look into this ?

[18/9/17, 4:28:14 PM] Abel Khoo: @6597529151 reply to ypour question
[18/9/17, 4:54:35 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Okay
[18/9/17, 4:54:37 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Danke
[19/9/17, 7:51:50 AM] Megan ARROW: Omg guys the extra HC elements are still with me!!!!
[19/9/17, 8:18:05 AM] Loocurse ARROW: See on carousell
[19/9/17, 8:18:07 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Sell
[19/9/17, 9:29:32 AM] Abel Khoo: Thanks ky for typing it out:) 

The rest:) waiting to hear what y'all have to say too:)
[19/9/17, 10:24:24 AM] Kim Lim: What was good?
Overall: we were super on time!!!
Breakout: core youths helmed the whole sharing session and made the j1s share as well. Some of them were also active in asking questions. 

What could have been improved?
Abit more time for breakout (to pray for each other, life update)

What was your take away?
Being bold in starting the ball rolling and not feeling awkward during facilitation. And that there's more to tithing, other than tithing money. Learning what are some of the practical ways to tithe my emotions and time was also a new insight.
[19/9/17, 10:31:30 AM] Loocurse ARROW: What was good?
Overall flow was good. I felt splitting up the sharing into two bits especially for a topic like this made things flow better.

What could be better?
Time management. Time overan for worship and breakouts which affected Abels sharing. We can work on dis :))

Take away
DELEGATE if you're holding an important role lol and if possible delegate to youths
[19/9/17, 10:40:32 AM] Abel Khoo: Any more besides rachel lee?
[19/9/17, 10:46:42 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Nope. No more. We asked Michaela but she said she would rather serve in the CG as a core
[19/9/17, 10:50:33 AM] Abel Khoo: Ok cool
[19/9/17, 10:52:04 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: What was good:
- Worship and the transition between songs
- Sharing by Abel and Kylie are engaging
- Breakout size is cosy
- Exhortation and 

What could be better:
- Communication, the speaker introducing the breakout should explicitly say what time to gather
- Maybe we could have an MC like person that can help with the coordination of the change between events
- The CGM is a little confusing for the youths

Personal Takeaway:
- The idea of tithing the friendship
- Facilitation was a fantastic experience, facilitators should really visualize how they would run the facilitation
[19/9/17, 10:08:47 PM] Berwin ARROW: Y'all want to hang this Saturday after svc at my place? :) I'll ask my parents if we can hang say from 8-10 to play board games and chill
[19/9/17, 10:12:04 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Haha sorry i cant join yall:)
[19/9/17, 10:12:26 PM] Abel Khoo: You gg airport right?
[19/9/17, 10:12:53 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Yupp! 10pm thereabouts
[19/9/17, 11:19:11 PM] Berwin ARROW: What was good 
- worship (Michaela is rly rly good, we should keep her in mind for future worship opportunities even as she serves in core)

What could be better
- clarify asap on CGM

Personal takeaway
- I'm actually rly excited to pass the baton on to tierney/tim as they run w the vision for the CG 😁
[20/9/17, 12:09:26 AM] Vanessa: What was good:
- Worship was good!!!
- I think the breakout was good too cos the youths were generally interested and engaged and whoohoo
- flow

What could be better:
- time management

Personal Takeaway:
- Having a personal revelation of the CGM makes sharing easier and more sincere
[20/9/17, 8:02:37 AM] Rachel Koh: What was good:
-Worship! It kinda felt like service worship super anointed

What could be better:
- sharing could have been a bit shorter so can have more time for breakout

Personal takeaway:
- tithing is beyond money
-sometimes calling out names during breakout (ask them to answer qns) is easier than just waiting there forever
[20/9/17, 11:54:49 AM] Abel Khoo: reminder tonight got leaders meeting(: at *STAR*
[20/9/17, 11:55:43 AM] Vanessa: 0K13E T4NK5 4B3L
[20/9/17, 12:03:36 PM] Megan ARROW: What was good:
- Worship was so so good, it was so anointed, I really loved it. (Can we have her do nxt cluster worship again ☺☺)

What could be better:
- Time management, keeping to the time. I think we have a tendency to think that 2.5 hours for cluster is the norm although our plan is 2hrs

Personal takeaway:
- The principle of firstfruits and that tithing can be for emotions too (I mean i knew about journalling and the benefits of it but i never thought of it as tithing emotions to the Lord)
[20/9/17, 12:03:54 PM] Megan ARROW: Okay!!

[20/9/17, 7:03:03 PM] Berwin ARROW: Are y'all at kitchen?
[20/9/17, 7:11:02 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Yes
[21/9/17, 12:34:16 AM] Berwin ARROW: Does anyone have notes/recording from tonight's meeting? :> was really blessed by it and I just wanted to review the practical handles shared by the panel again haha
[21/9/17, 8:42:34 AM] Loocurse ARROW: I saw Kaijie taking notes! Can ask @6598712012
[21/9/17, 10:04:10 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Okay! I will distribute here!
[21/9/17, 10:50:09 AM] Berwin ARROW: Anyway, I meditated on Pro 27:17. And tried to look up the meaning of sharpen (chadad in Hebrew) and it's context in the bible but it didn't really help haha. 

Then the Lord asked me to go figure out if a sword/knife can sharpen another knife. And I was like "ya can what why not right?", but just to be sure I googled. And guess what, the answer is a resounding NO hahaha. 

A knife can only be sharpened by something harder than it. When 2 knives are used to hone each other both will become duller and damage each other. Because the material of both knives aren't meant for this purpose. That's why we need a honing steel.

And it was like the Lord speaking to me! We can look up the root of man and friend inside the verse which states that we are weak in nature, very much like the knife iron. Sharpening the countenance of a friend with our own human/worldly words will probably do more harm than help our friend. It is through His aid (our honing steel) that we can truly sharpen the countenance of our friend. That the words that come out of our mouth are in line with His ways and love for us. 

Also sort of spoke to me that the weapon He has given us and sharpened for us is not meant to be used against our friends but against the enemy. And that the more we use the honing steel, the more we dwell in His presence and Word, the more we know how to teach it to our friends that they may use it, and spread this to more people as well!

I rarely have such revelations like these haha, so really PTL!
[21/9/17, 10:50:18 AM] Berwin ARROW: From tierney^ ☺☺☺
[21/9/17, 11:57:37 AM] Evitata 🥑🍳: a bit too late to send my feedback HAHAHA but here it goes
[21/9/17, 11:57:41 AM] Evitata 🥑🍳: What was good?
1. started and ended on time
2. The facilitation group was just nice 
3. Worship!!!
4. The youths told me that the message spoke to them (especially on how you can tithe your time and emotions)
What could have been improved?
1. a lot of filler time during sharing
2. time management (especially for the sharings so we can have more time for breakout)
What was your take away?
1. my youths were so sweet and they knew it was my first time facilitating so they encouraged me :'-)
2. my facilitation ended early and I was kinda worried that we would've had awkward convos but my entire group just facilitated itself and the end and they ended up sharing with each other on how they can handle the practical tips :'-)
[22/9/17, 12:46:16 PM] Abel Khoo: Thanks evita!!

[19/10/17, 11:01:21 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Emphasis in breakout:
(X) Preaching
Application
Practical help

Teach the youths how to Bible Study
- How to bring the story alive and establish what you can receive from the story.
- How to make it practical(How to have great faith):
Both had impossible situation.
Both asked the Lord.
Both are under gentiles and never knew the Law.

We are the same as these people, we are gentiles, we have our impossible situations, today why dont we just share what is one impossible situation we have today <this is the inward - in what area we can exercise our small faith (This is the being loved by the Lord part)

Outward - meaning? What are the things that are in your hearts? To do? The things that you feel you have too little faith to do. (This is the live loving part)

This sharing you can remember and help follow up later on.

[22/10/17, 4:36:42 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Wow
[22/10/17, 7:50:26 AM] Kim Lim: What was good
What can be improved on
What did I catch from the session
[22/10/17, 8:29:44 AM] Berwin ARROW: What was good
- good reminder of the simplicity of the gospel (ie more room for Jesus to show up and be real in my own life), *breakout* went well w Tim/Tierney (the boys are rly doing well, flowing q well each other even as they did it for the first time)
*berwin* talked much less in comparison to previous breakouts hallelujah

what can be improved 
- more *interaction* across South as a whole, perhaps we can play cluster games/ warm up games before Cluster even starts like outside the venue whether at star or cuppage,

what did I catch from the session
- serving really *saves*, one of the best ways to get youths invested and be fed.  
Shall continue to trust God for more depths to send the youths out, as well as creating more serving roles in my CG
[22/10/17, 8:34:30 AM] HFRyan ARROW: What was good.
Abel's sharing, it was simple it was engaging and the whole message was for everyone.

What can be improved.
Being more detailed with the ops plan and passing the details down to the others

What I took away
Even in the midst of everything there is still time to reach out to the one that Jesus knows is hurting :) and you can be a blessing regardless of your state
[22/10/17, 9:01:27 AM] Berwin ARROW: @6597529151 singles seminar on? HAHHAHAHA (6 dollars)

[22/10/17, 10:58:45 PM] Vanessa: Not 21 nvm right HAHA
[22/10/17, 11:08:17 PM] Kylie ARROW : LOL
[22/10/17, 11:08:20 PM] Kylie ARROW : thanksss
[22/10/17, 11:26:10 PM] Vanessa: What was good
- the message was easy to understand and very applicable to many of the youths
- Timely and encouraging message 
- I think facilitation went pretty well for me, all the youths that I took talked and there was less talking on my part as compared to previously 

What can be improved on
- transition and having a backup plan for unforeseen circumstances 

What did I catch from the session
- l was reminded again of who the person of Jesus is and how good he is to me 
- You need faith for everything related to the word 

:)
[23/10/17, 1:10:14 AM] Kim Lim: What was good: Worship!!! + message was timely for me + abel's sharing was simple and easy to understand 

What can be improved: spend more time on meditating the verses so I can be more equipped for facilitation + can ask youths to be more on time so everything else can start on time

What I caught: we need faith for everything and it doesn't matter how small or big our faith is because as Long as we have faith, Jesus is happy. But we need to increase our faith and Not just stay stagnant.
[23/10/17, 7:27:10 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Good: CR sharing - felt it brought the message to a personal level that the youths can relate to.

Can be improved: Punctuality of the youths (since it's the first time at cuppage for J1s, let's give them BOD).

What I caught: I should text my youths :(
[23/10/17, 11:04:10 AM] Berwin ARROW: hahhaha hahahah HAHAHAHAHA
[23/10/17, 11:05:07 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Yeah felt like I needed to "wake up my idea"

[23/10/17, 11:10:06 AM] Megan ARROW: So cant go for the singles seminar

[23/10/17, 11:10:35 AM] Megan ARROW: I WANNA PLAY AND GET COUPONS

[23/10/17, 11:10:54 AM] Berwin ARROW: Time zone got coupons?
[23/10/17, 11:11:07 AM] Megan ARROW: Omg okay that works
[23/10/17, 11:11:23 AM] Megan ARROW: i think they just started also, not too sure but its alright!! Lets play at PS!!
[23/10/17, 11:11:43 AM] Megan ARROW: But lets not do too late heh
[23/10/17, 11:13:02 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Yeap thats why its asking not a must mah HAHAHAHA
[23/10/17, 11:13:29 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Cluster > Seminar but dont ask dont know
[23/10/17, 11:13:56 AM] Megan ARROW: Aye okie gotcha 👍🏻😂
[23/10/17, 11:25:46 AM] Megan ARROW: Good: The sharing, it really set the tone for cluster and I like how the main point was repeated many times -> made sure that the youths had that as their main takeaway. Plus the message was really timely especially during this period that is the most hectic for the J1s and J2s

Can be improved: For facilitation, youths were still kinda quiet, but can tell that they are more willing to share, just that they were not sure of how to put their thought across

What I caught: That outward faith kinda ties in with boldness as well (a number of the youths answered the 2nd qn saying they wanted to bring some of their friends to church so thats what i caught from there)
[23/10/17, 12:49:29 PM] Rachel Koh: Good: worship!! Breakout was good too cos this time the youths could and did share more (thanks abel for joining!!!)

Can be improved: meditate and make sense of the cgm earlier cos i only did so that morning

What i caught: timely reminder for me also!! To not settle and to have a confident expectation of good in situations I’ve given up on cos God is out to bless me :-)
[23/10/17, 12:57:57 PM] Rachel Koh: Omg guys okok mini testimony and prayer request

[29/10/17, 1:09:53 AM] Kylie ARROW : hi guys i feel a bit out of place not seeing y'all on saturday so here is my life update
[29/10/17, 1:09:54 AM] Kylie ARROW : my day was just ok i think all the good things and bad things cancelled each other out lol. i was listening to the same sermon twice the whole day today but i don't feel like anything sunk in cos in that sermon pastor showed a lot of iillustrations so it was a bit difficult to follow the audio sermon. ok but i still did go find other ways to just feed myself - i read a rly nice devotional from some bible app. but anw i rly felt like i just had the whole day to myself and Jesus cos both my brother and my mom are out doing their own thing so my mom told me to cook my own dinner tonight, she said there was some raw chicken that she asked me to finish up so ok. i rly wanted to eat creamy pasta and so i googled and the recipe looked easy enough but then after i cooked the chicken and my mushrooms cos i was too lazy to take them out from the pan i thought i could just make the sauce and everything in the same pan but NO the stupid flour stick to the chicken instead of the butter and DINNER WAS RUINED and the pan took a long time to clean and i was so frustrated and i still had the cooked pasta sitting in the pot and i rly just wanted to throw it away everything and not eat cos i was so frustrated at how i wasted my time like omg i was rly rly rly RLYYY frustrated so i complained to God out loud since i was the only one at home "omg i just wasted so  much time kjashdflksajhdfklahsj" and then when i was done cleaning up i had half a mind to throw away the cooked pasta alrd then i just felt like God was saying "try again" and that made me even more frustrated cos TRY FOR WHAT kjsahldflkhjs then after staring at the pasta for a while i thought FINE GOD I WILL TRY AGAIN JUST BECAUSE YOU SAID SO and so i did try again to make the cream sauce and omg it all worked out!!!!!!
[29/10/17, 1:10:00 AM] Kylie ARROW : so in the end i had creamy mushroom pasta wo the chicken
[29/10/17, 1:10:05 AM] Kylie ARROW : and it didn't take up too much time
[29/10/17, 1:10:10 AM] Kylie ARROW : then i realised even though in my head i thought GOD I AM COOKING FOR YOU I AM COOKING AGAIN JUST BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO but in reality i guess He was asking me to try again not for Him but for myself lol cos if not if i had just stopped there i would probably have been frustrated w myself through the night.
[29/10/17, 1:10:17 AM] Kylie ARROW : so that wholeeeee episode made me realise that God is a gracious God because He cares for such a small matter in my life lol like it's just cooking but in that one moment of failure cooking felt like the whole world to me lol
[29/10/17, 1:25:50 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Wew what a journey Kylie:) thanks for sharing even the lil frustration you encountered! I need that reminder again! Believing that your short break will be one that the revelation of God is revealed to you in a fresh new way:)
[29/10/17, 1:35:30 AM] Kylie ARROW : Yessss amennn
[29/10/17, 1:59:08 AM] Vanessa: Yes!!!!!!!! Amen!!!!
[29/10/17, 10:35:39 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Woo nice!! Oh ya there was one time I woke up at 6am to cook eggs for my mum. Then I kept screwing it up, I was so frustrated!! So I totally relate to destroying food LOL yes God puts his fingerprints all over our lives and the beauty of life is just to see all these!
[29/10/17, 12:34:33 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hahahaha awwwww ❤❤❤ we missed you too ky
[29/10/17, 12:35:47 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yas He really is a gracious God and wah what a super real way of showing how His grace gives 2nd chances and how His heart is always towards us 💖 if not you will be triggered by creamy chicken pasta from now on lolol
[29/10/17, 12:37:40 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Sounds like a super good time with the Lord and am praying that you'll have more of such encounters with Him 😊
[29/10/17, 12:37:58 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Sameeee I've thrown away whole batches of baked things before.........
[29/10/17, 1:34:54 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hi guys, so as mentioned yesterday, in addition to the survey on counselling (tinyurl.com/arrowhelps) which i know yall are faithful and diligent shepherds to do.... 😊🙃

We would like to differentiate the number of more critical cases for each CG over the past year (as described below). This is separate from the info collected on the link as the other information is being collected anonymously 😊

🔹Health (H): Serious physical and mental health cases, such as chronic sickness, incurable diseases, self harm, suicidal, hospitalization, death of close family member

🔹Addiction (A): Serious addictions, such as eating disorders, gaming addiction, drugs, smoking, sexual addictions (pornography) 

🔹Criminal (C): Police cases, stealing, borrowing money, gang fights, premarital sex for minors, boys/girls home

🔹Sexual (S): Sexual confusion, sexual abuse, heavy petting, premarital sex, molestation, rape, incest, unwanted pregnancy, abortion 
—————

*Please send me the info for your CG acc to these 2 categories:*

1) No. of HACS cases
2) No. of all other counselling cases

1 leader per CG to PM to me. Thanks all! 🙆🏻
(Link for counselling survey: tinyurl.com/arrowhelps)
[29/10/17, 7:07:16 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey guys, to add on to the admin:

5. Attendance descriptors - we'll be doing this every week from now on 😊 it's to help explain the numbers (Give a few lines). Was it a normal/high/low attendance for your CG this week? What are the reasons/factors? E.g. CCA camps, A levels, cohort retreat, youths brought their friends. 

6. CG plans by Tuesday night! Love the J2s
[29/10/17, 7:08:39 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Can i clarify what point 6 is about? The CG plan revolves around loving the J2s?
[29/10/17, 7:15:01 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Okay so, this coming week is the week right before A levels start. Last year we had a spontaneous plan of bluffing the J2s that CG is cancelled, then the rest of the CG and us went to stalk them around singapore and gave them some snacks and prayed for them as a blessing 

But our AAR after that showed that it would have been better if we gave the youths more ownership of it rather than the leaders driving it 

So this year if y'all want to do something similar, also can, but as ryan highlighted, it might be a bit too last minute to discuss / let the J1s and NSFs plan it. But I'll leave it to y'all.
[29/10/17, 7:15:24 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: If y'all are doing a conventional CG, can share something tailored for the J2s, e.g. Victory in Christ; our identity is in Christ not in our results; the battle is the Lord's. because from our meeting and sharing yesterday it seems that quite a lot of J2s are under attack, stressing themselves over it and being under the pressure to perform.

Please pray over the J2s too as a CG :)

Blessed Afternoon to you!! I’m asking on behalf of the *DARE Mission Trip*.

As they will be heading for Mission in late Nov to Dec. They will need help with packing & receiving their donation drives items.

They will need about  *20 helpers* during the donation drives on *19 and 26 Nov*. The donations will be at *Shine level 6*. Packing timing from *10-11am (upper sec service) for 19 Nov*, *11am-12pm (combined service) for 26 Nov.*

As the Big Brothers & Sisters of DARE, Let’s lend a hand to them in this. So could you please help me to ask your youths if they are able to help out in these 2 dates.

Should you have any youths interested, Please kindly PM me. Thank you for being a blessing to the ministry!!🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂

Love,
Des

Romans 12:3-18 and 1 Corinthians 12:4-27
• Everyone brings something different to the table and only when we acknowledge that will we all be able to work together👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
• We are one body of Christ, there are many subsets to it, NCC could be the arm of the body, Arrow could be one finger and South Cluster could be one of the joints.🖐🏻Everyone works together to build the body of Christ and just like how each part of the body has a different function, we all have different functions. 🖐🏻🖐🏼🖐🏽🖐🏾🖐🏿 But when we work together, thats when something great happens!! 🤝😎
[12/11/17, 11:55:17 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Wow thanks Megan!! So comprehensive and colourful 💥

[12/11/17, 5:12:14 PM] Kylie ARROW : HAHAHAHAHAHA
[12/11/17, 7:00:11 PM] Megan ARROW: CG Attendance : Quite normal, just missing one of our regulars

Reason: Family dinner if Im not wrong 🍱

Service 🕢 (yay or nay): Youths didnt say they found it bad, but were more curious as to why the timing was changed for that day. I found it quite good actually, cus I liked how majority of the youths (excluding those serving) were able to join us for dinner before service started (they dont normally come for lunch) ☺☺
[12/11/17, 7:37:02 PM] HFRyan ARROW: CG Attendance : Mmmm alot of the irregular J2s didnt come this time

Reason: A levels period

Service 🕢 (yay or nay): It was good like they were definitely blessed, some of them said that it differed from expectations coz the P&W wasnt as extended as much as they thought (Same I agree). But definitely a good service overall.
[12/11/17, 8:27:06 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Hey guys tomorrow night *9pm* we will be having a Skype meeting to discuss the CGM for this coming cluster :) 

Probably 1.5hours or so. 

Please do read the CGM in advance and prepare any possible questions you might have before hand :)
[12/11/17, 11:23:49 PM] Berwin ARROW: CG attendance: less than 50% :(

Reason: i need to pick up the ball again Jesus let's go, Alevels, timeshift (family dinner clash, edsheeran can sing almost as well as eli)

Service: (yay) but hard to have a proper worship experience with all the chairs, let's borrow capitol if we have worship service next time so we can really JUMP JUMP JUMP
[12/11/17, 11:24:46 PM] Berwin ARROW: ok :)
[12/11/17, 11:25:35 PM] Kylie ARROW : think capitol too small leh
[12/11/17, 11:25:47 PM] Kylie ARROW : unless jc and poly split
[12/11/17, 11:27:32 PM] Megan ARROW: ‘Ed sheeran can sing almost as well as eli’ 😂😂😂
[12/11/17, 11:27:54 PM] Megan ARROW: Waa but sitting on the floor tho 😐
[12/11/17, 11:28:19 PM] Loocurse ARROW: CG attendance: about 60% of normal arrow svc

Reason: main bulk of drop is from NS guys and a couple of J1s.

Svc: not very sure how it went but heard from feedback here and there that it's very refreshing esp for J2s
[12/11/17, 11:28:39 PM] Kylie ARROW : i love chairs
[12/11/17, 11:28:52 PM] Berwin ARROW: guys keep me in prayer pls haha, feel abit sian/attacked/dry (nothing big but just wanted to keep yall in the know, maybe cos i had to do admin lol)

but i was thinking of sth btw, shall we do this? let's send an emoji 🌚 when we don't want to explain the circumstances/ the circumstances can't be explained over text clearly/ the situation is dire. basically when we are
-sad/sian/angry/upset/not great

so we can keep each other in prayer, edify and encourage each other.
[12/11/17, 11:29:13 PM] Berwin ARROW: 🌚
[12/11/17, 11:29:50 PM] Kylie ARROW : ok will pray for you!!!!!
[12/11/17, 11:32:18 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okay Berwin praying for you!
Thank you Lord for Berwin, that you cast every single one of His thought to the obedience of You Lord and you protect him from the evil one. May you prepare a table before him in the midst of this trial and may goodness and mercy hunt him down especially so!! In jesus name amen!
[12/11/17, 11:32:49 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Anyway, I got impt qn!! What's with the fourth svc youth svc thing??
[12/11/17, 11:36:50 PM] Kylie ARROW : can pray for my mother and brother too pls they are both sick. my brother has been down with a rly bad flu/cough/fever this entire week so he stayed at home and only booked back in today. never seen him this sick before. I think my mom caught whatever he was sick with and she's been coughing too (but not as bad as him) so pls pray 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 i get irrational fears when my family members fall sick esp when it is my mum it is v traumatic for me ok thx 🙃🙃🙃

*"I am righteous, beloved, and I will prosper in all things and be in health, even as my soul prospers!!"*

Yaaassss 💥 It's God's heart for you guys and mine as well 🙆🏻 and because of Jesus' finished work, nothing coming against you this week (outward or inward) can stand! you shall be the head and not the tail, above only and not beneath! Amen! 💪🏻 Praying for you guys 💖

[13/11/17, 12:52:18 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks for the comments guys! For the 2nd part, it's more about the service TIMING (7.30pm) rather than the service itself. This is because we want to explore whether this timing is a viable option for future services.

So if you replied about service, pls revise your comments. (But appreciate your inputs on the service too!)
[13/11/17, 12:53:36 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: If you weren't around on sat, it's okay. So I'll just hear from the leaders who were there :)
[13/11/17, 3:02:17 PM] Megan ARROW: Amen!!!
[13/11/17, 6:32:08 PM] Berwin ARROW: Service timing: some youths missed because of previous plans, sat night is good, let's do sat night from now on HAHAHAH
[13/11/17, 6:34:53 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Service timing: wasnt able to spend time with the CG so... dont really know if I like it. The youths mingle for a lesser amount of time as compared to normal. Will ask them for their opinions, then revise again
[13/11/17, 6:45:04 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hahahaaha

[23/11/17, 12:29:11 PM] Berwin ARROW: hi guys :) just wanted to share a quick testimony w yall!!

i had lunch with edward on tuesday and initially it was rly just to find out if he was ok to be retaining.

but guess what haha, i was so shocked by what he told me (without 0% prompting)

- he wants to serve, whereever and whenever he can
- he told me that every morning he tells the lord, that His love is all he wants

his walk w the Lord is so pure haha and real. and so accelerated. and this is a boy who never knew of Jesus until he got saved the week after evangelical service eh. 

i rly thought that i would need to like counsel/ talk to him about his walk w the Lord, about retaining. but i ended up being so so blessed instead
[23/11/17, 12:30:11 PM] Berwin ARROW: 😭 may all of yall experience His love through your youths even more as we press into His presence and we shepherd His flocl

[30/11/17, 5:32:31 PM] Kylie ARROW : Hehe guys I just went back to school to meet my professor from my crisis management class.

During the sem we had a group project where we had to do a research paper on a topic of our choice regarding crisis management. And this week the prof emailed us to say that he was done grading and that some people can collect from the office  staff on weds and some had to personally collect it from him today. My group had to personally collect it from him today.

He wants to work with us on our paper to submit for a conference in New York that is happening next year and this conference has all the professors, practitioners and PhD students and it is by-invitation only based on whether the conference accepts our paper. But omg hehe I am so excited I am more excited to work on this than FYP. So in the next couple of months the prof will be working tgt w us to improve on the work we have alrd done to submit the paper 😭👍🏼 and I’m gna be the lead author of the paper so it is gna be (Sng, Au, Lim & Pang, 2018)/(Sng et al., 2018) !!!!!!!!!!! 

And if the paper is good enough post conference the prof *may* want to work w us to submit it for publications then it’ll become (Sng, Au, Lim & Pang, 2020)/(Sng et al., 2020)!!!!

[2/12/17, 1:34:10 PM] Berwin ARROW: Attendance: average!! Could be better if the (3/4) girl clique didn’t pull out all together at the very last min.

Reasons: 1 j1 just came back from overseas, 1 of my army boys thought CG was on sat instead of Friday, haven’t been texting my youths as much.
[2/12/17, 5:25:19 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hey everyone :) just wanted to share a short testimony about CG yesterday. Essentially over the past 2 weeks I felt attacked over a few occasions, like just a lousy cgl in general (never shepherd properly) and yesterday until like 5plus before CG started I wasn’t ready. But Jesus rly rly showed up haha, the sharing was super raw and v real. Like we just got to share abt lowlights and highlights of the year, and it was truly like family uh. That CG didn’t feel like CG yknow, but like family, like having supper with your friends and you know you should probably leave to go home but you just don’t want to. It was the best CG I’ve ever had la haha and it was in spite of my weakness, like never prep the worship team properly (worship was a joke at the start hahahhaa), yet His presence can still fall, breakout change at least 2x until I also confused, my sharing cut from 15 to 5min, CG overrun by 2 hours plus cos even tho we officially dismissed by 930 nobody wanted to leave. So yah. If He can do it for me, He can do it for all of us this afternoon and tonight🙌🏼
[2/12/17, 5:28:21 PM] Kim Lim: Yasss amen!!!! Thank you for sharing Berwin!!
[2/12/17, 9:42:15 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Attendance: Below average. We never text to find out why. Less than half the j1s appeared  and the j2s only had the regular ones. Had

Reasons: i am not sure why, havent text much of them recently.
[2/12/17, 9:44:41 PM] Kim Lim: Attendance: significantly less than normal. Only 1 j2 came and the 5 regular j1s came. Didn't text them as well to find out why. (Only: dexter has chalet and Andrew is overseas)
[2/12/17, 9:56:54 PM] Megan ARROW: CG Attendance: Lesser than usual, but our irregular came!!! ☺☺

Reason: A couple of them had family stuff, the rest of our regulars are overseas (fam hols)

[9/12/17, 11:00:30 PM] Loocurse ARROW: SA B Attendance

Generally good, with some overseas and a couple of NS guise missing. Quite a few of them brought friends but they didn't know if the friends accepted Christ because of the way the service went. (and yeah they didnt ask hahah) 

TBH: I felt the service flow was a bit awkward and not sure what pastor dan was trying to bring across. maybe it's because im too used to the normal arrow flow hahah (I hope it is). Like for example, the giving of the gifts I felt was a bit too early, he should have set up the moment. Also, altar call didn't allow them to come up to the front (but im sure there's a reason behind this) so yeah ahhaha
[10/12/17, 12:11:34 AM] Megan ARROW: CJ A Attendance

Not too good, less than usual. Only 3 of our regulars made it today, and none of the irregulars came. 

Reason: A number of them are still overseas, Parry is stuck in camp cus of guard duty :(

even if they don't come back, extending that love plays a part in their journey of knowing Jesus ☺ every life is precious!

If you didn't get their number can check with your youth (their friend) how service was for them :)

[13/12/17, 4:52:13 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hey guys was just reading Romans (spiritual gifts and loving practically) and this verse “cling to what is good” jumped out at me.

So I checked the blb for the Greek translation and I realised the more accurate word for it was “cleave”. And if you look in the blue letter bible it says “to join or fasten firmly together”. 

And it just reminded me of sth

- of how Jesus *cleaved* Himself, literally as the psalmist beautifully writes “I can count all my bones, They look and stare at me”. 

- He *fastened* himself to the cross, to die the most horrible deaths one can die

- divinity sealed Himself with the worst of men as He *joined* Himself to us, ““For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.”
‭‭
Today we can love our youths practically (largeness of heart), to see the gold where others cannot (trust Him for discerning eyes), cling to the small things (not despise the days of small beginnings) _only because He first *cleaved*, *fastened*, *joined* Himself to us_ , loved us for who we are right here right now.

Blessed Christmas guys☺ love y’all
[13/12/17, 5:06:41 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Amennnn ☺ yas what love it is that Jesus cleaved Himself to the cross 😢 thanks for sharing berwin!!

[5/1/18, 9:08:45 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Hello everyone❗❗

Last month we had our cluster Christmas party at Odele's house in which we collected $10 from all of y'all. After the event, we had some money left over, so for those who attended and paid the $10, yall can choose to:

1. get back *$2.70* in change, OR
2. let the money go towards organizing our next cluster event! (South cluster bash in Feb 🎈)

Please let your CGLs know by 12 Jan if you want to collect your change! If not, the remainder will be used in our next cluster event!

Thanks guys! Please PM Lucas (97836744) or Sherrie (8100 2833) if you have any questions
[5/1/18, 9:09:07 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Hey leaders can yall send this to your chats? 🙂 any qns can ask here too
[5/1/18, 9:20:42 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Okay! Thanks Lucas
[5/1/18, 9:51:49 AM] Rachel Koh: Okayy thanks lu
[5/1/18, 1:02:47 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks lucas! :)
[5/1/18, 7:10:56 PM] Kylie ARROW : Eh
[5/1/18, 7:11:01 PM] Kylie ARROW : https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/05/apple-mac-spectre-meltdown-iphone-ipad-hackers
[5/1/18, 7:11:05 PM] Kylie ARROW : Apple got bug ah?
[5/1/18, 7:11:31 PM] Kylie ARROW : ??? My devices are working fine
[5/1/18, 7:16:53 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: to put it simply there is a flaw affecting not just apple. There are three major chip manufacturers: Intel, AMD & ARM. And all three are affected including windows. 

The flaw in summary is that the part of the cpu whcih stores the password has low level encryption which would mean that if the OS of a computer (ie OSx and Windows) is not secure enough, any application can access that part of the cpu and retrieve all known passwords. So in order to prevent that there are two ways:

1) change the cpu = change the whole motherboard
2) strengthen the operating system to increase the security.

The latter is more feasible thus the urge to update the operating system. That being said, the speed will be slower across all devices. So not to worry, just update your software and when you change phone or device, hopefully by then the latest chips are all secured.
[5/1/18, 7:18:22 PM] Kylie ARROW : Oh wow ok that is one solid summary
[5/1/18, 7:18:36 PM] Kylie ARROW : I was still slowly reading through different articles LOL

[5/1/18, 7:54:09 PM] Loocurse ARROW: My graphics card is Intel
[5/1/18, 7:55:19 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Na bro you are also probably affected

[22/1/18, 10:11:05 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hi guys!! I wanna share something today! And this is because something has really dropped in my heart after hearig ytd’s sermon. 

So recently reality struck me: i got work, relationships to invest in, ministry, my own walk with the Lord, coding self learning to manage and gym. And i realized that i am really hard pressed for time and spiralled into a mini state of confusion and lost. Then during ytd’s sermon, while pastor was preaching i began thinking of those stuff again. For some reason the Lord dropped in me this idea to memorize the book of proverbs (i know Abel already encouraged us to do so), and i felt like okay, sounds good but i want to know if its the Lord or if its just me making a “religion”. And so i asked God for grace to do so and show me from the word if that is His direction. Lo and behold today’s proverbs:

“Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise, And apply your heart to my knowledge; *For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; Let them all be fixed upon your lips*,”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭22:17-18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
http://bible.com/114/pro.22.17-18.nkjv

The last part got to me. So, i am gna try to memorize the book of proverbs and i would encouraged yall to have a revelation before doing so otherwise it is really challenging. So you can join Abel and myself now 😁 

P.S. we still need grace to memorize 31 chapters 😅
[22/1/18, 10:32:52 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Wowz thats awesome Kj HAHAHA
[22/1/18, 10:33:01 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Yet super daunting 😂
[22/1/18, 10:33:09 AM] HFRyan ARROW: But will keep you in prayer for that
[22/1/18, 10:33:41 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Thanks 🙂
[22/1/18, 11:56:40 AM] Berwin ARROW: Keeping u in prayer bro :) and wow ok I’ll start to think about whether I wanna memorise proverbs as well HAHAHA
[22/1/18, 12:08:22 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Memorising it is tough maaaaan :/
[22/1/18, 1:04:01 PM] Abel Khoo: start w prob 9,  think its the easiest/ shortest

[23/1/18, 3:41:00 PM] ‪+65 9222 6395‬: Hi South Team, just wanna take the opportunity as we enter the tail end of Jan 2018 to say I am extremely proud of you guys and it has been an amazing journey seeing many of you being raised up to take your place in ministry, as leaders, pastoral servers as well as the various department leaders and all. 

I really think that you guys are the next generation and you will continue to raise the pillars of the next generation of Arrow youths whom are strong and spiritual. 

I want to let you guys know that I will be focusing a little more in DARE in 2018, as such, for Arrow, I will be playing more of a mentoring role behind the scenes. 

With that I will be taking my leave from all the Arrow chat groups, I know Arrow is in the great hands of Janan, Debs and all the amazing overseers. 

I will definitely be still around, “lurking in the background” to look out for you guys. 😎 

Do feel free to catch up for coffee or lunch! 🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂
[23/1/18, 10:10:04 PM] Berwin ARROW: see you around ps :)

[24/1/18, 12:35:48 PM] Vanessa: i was reading psalms 116, specifically verses 5-9. In verse 6, it says "The LORD preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me." my question is, what does it mean to be simple?
[24/1/18, 12:36:29 PM] Vanessa: i searched blb for meaning and all, and it says foolish, open-minded
[24/1/18, 12:36:53 PM] Vanessa: but foolishness??? i mean, aren't we all trying to acquire wisdom
[24/1/18, 12:37:07 PM] Vanessa: or is that in itself foolishness to the world?
[24/1/18, 12:37:18 PM] Vanessa: ok thats my question and some elaboration hahah
[24/1/18, 12:38:16 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Abel, sherrie, lucas pls go^
[24/1/18, 12:38:43 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Lol jkjk i will go home and check it out, but yes indeed it seems that simple is contradicting what we were told to be wise
[24/1/18, 12:38:50 PM] Vanessa: kj, sherrie is not a guy
[24/1/18, 12:38:59 PM] Vanessa: hahah kidding
[24/1/18, 12:40:24 PM] Kylie ARROW : I don’t quite have a definition for what simple is but I’ve searched compared the difference between fools and simple before (because they appear in Proverbs a lot) and they are pretty different. From what I remember, the simple comes across to me as someone who is naive and a fool is someone who is arrogant in his own ways.
[24/1/18, 12:43:03 PM] Berwin ARROW: The Hebrew word for “*trust* (in the Lord)” is actually the same word for *foolishness* in the Hebrew. 

So when it says that The Lord preserves the _simple_, it actually means that He preserves the *foolish* one, that our faith in Him is actually almost foolish. That we trust in Him foolishly, that our trust in Him can be  foolish/ illogical, because His finished work at the cross was foolish/illogical/ reckless and relentless
[24/1/18, 12:44:19 PM] Berwin ARROW: Actually *foolish*, ignore the almost finish (it’s a typo) 

Hope it makes sense vans :) if not I’ll explain to you later again haha
[24/1/18, 12:50:19 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Its also the fact that the Lord saves the foolish. All of us without Christ could not get Godly wisdom coz we have no access to any of Gods riches. But yeah the Lord preserves and saves the foolish ah. If not we are all gone. 

But that doesnt mean we do not seek wisdom :) the Lord saves us in our foolishness but at the same time grows us in wisdom.

[24/1/18, 12:55:59 PM] HFRyan ARROW: The word trust
[24/1/18, 12:56:11 PM] HFRyan ARROW: I asked myself this this morning

- Freshies' posting results will be released this Thur. JC youths report to school on Fri

- CLuster bash is happening on Sat. Hence, we want to quickly contact and invite these Freshies for Cluster. 

- Events team will be creating an online cloud sheet (Google Sheets) where posting results will be collected and consolidated simultaneously, and sorted according to JC/POLITE, and cluster

- Separately, i will be sent a database of the Freshies contact numbers. The Events team can't put these on the Google Sheets due to PDPA.

- This data will then be shared to you guys via me. :)

[1/2/18, 10:17:25 PM] Kylie ARROW : Hey Arrow Leaders! Our Freshies are receiving their posting results today! This means that they will be joining our CGs tmr:) 

We’ve help set up a Google sheet for all of us. The DG Reps are updating it all the time with the latest postings of their youths, so you can keep checking the sheet to get the latest info:) 

Your role:
	⁃	Check the sheet regularly today and tmr
	⁃	Contact the Freshies posted to your CG, and invite them for CG on Friday:) 

I’ve created a note that has more information on what you need to do and about the sheet. also, I’ve also shared your contact info with the Freshies so some of them may start contacting you themselves:) 

Let’s believe that as one Arrow family, our nets shall be strong and we shall not lose a single one of the precious Freshies!:) Lemme know if you have any questions:)

[11/2/18, 9:21:56 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Admin stuffzz!!! 😊 haha plz take some time to listen

1. AV Camp signups 
2. AA
3. Ambs
4. Cluster sessions (March, May)
5. Better together as a team; internal sharing
[11/2/18, 9:23:25 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: AMBS

Here are some things that could guide your selection ☺:
1) able to commit to 6 months of biweekly serving + 2 training dates
2) regular in your CG
3) teachable
4) would be a *good representation* of Arrow Ministry 😊

Let’s confirm the names by *Saturday, 24 Feb* :-)
[11/2/18, 9:26:24 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks guys 😊😊
[11/2/18, 10:30:18 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hi Sherrie i like the ideas of thematic clusters! And although we have men’s and women’s meeting would it be good to have our own version so that any questions they have can be clarified? And also for the youths to know first hand from our own mouths about our viewpoints? 

Also the idea of alumni’s coming back is goood!! Can help those preparing for uni to know what to look out for. 

Our own  internal serving team; how would it differ from what we do now? Or is it gna be status quo.? 

Thanks sherrie 😁
[11/2/18, 10:35:02 PM] Vanessa: I listened to the recording! 💪🏻
[11/2/18, 10:36:35 PM] Vanessa: Btw I wanna ask, next Arrow is men and women’s meeting right? And it’s at different timings? So how does that work?? Like the male leaders attend the men’s meeting and the female leaders attend the women’s meeting? Or can go both?
[11/2/18, 11:07:00 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: My hunch is that it will occur simultaneously.
[12/2/18, 8:16:47 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Mmhmm :) good point, thanks for raising this! I think it can be addressed at the following CG after the M&W meetings actually (and actually it would already start at the fellowship after the service; small intimate settings, lots of time after svc 👍🏻) it might be a bit too late to wait until the next cluster session, coz another arrow service would have gone past by then. But I’ll keep this in mind and consider :) 

Internal serving team - it would be more regular, more formalized, less adhoc. Currently it’s quite adhoc. And don’t really have dedicated youths taking on decor, ops/program, coordinating worship. Either these positions are taken by leaders or non-existent 😊
[12/2/18, 8:17:05 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks for the input KJ! 👍🏻
[12/2/18, 8:19:21 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: M&W cluster - an alternative is to spread it out & have it a few months later so that it’s fresh for them without clashing with service schedule :)
[12/2/18, 8:19:38 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Haha yup correct. Guys won’t be allowed at women’s meeting and girls won’t be allowed at men’s meeting!
[12/2/18, 8:19:58 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Men’s meeting is at an earlier timing FYI!
[12/2/18, 8:20:15 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Anddddd
[12/2/18, 8:20:25 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: AV Camp signup is today!!!

[14/2/18, 8:15:31 PM] Kylie ARROW : Hellooooo, it was my turn to share today on my VG chat so I thought to share w y’all too.

“Why are you in despair, O my soul?And why are you restless and disturbed within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall again praise Him, The help of my [sad] countenance and my God.”
‭‭PSALM‬ ‭43:5‬ ‭AMP‬‬

Idk about you but being a comms student (or mb just a millennial lol) I’m constantly plugged in to social media and it’s shocking to me sometimes how my life can be going just fine but when I open social media and see what others are up to, it makes me feel like I am lacking so much in my life. I start to feel so dissatisfied and that snowballs into a bunch of other nasty feelings.

I love how the verse reminds us that in moments where our feelings/despair/restlessness shocks us, we don’t have to settle for those feelings nor let them define us. Instead we can point our souls to God - our Hope and the anchor for our souls. ⚓

Watch how the psalmist does it

1⃣ He questions the source of that dissatisfaction.

_*Why* are you in despair, O my soul?_

👉🏼 it is OK to ask “WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS”. Because that’s when you’ll know what you’ve been letting into your soul that’s been brewing that distress. For me, it was the comparison from scrolling on Instagram la.

2⃣ He points his soul back to the Lord

_*Hope in God* and wait expectantly for Him._

👉🏼 LOOK 2 JESUS 👀👀👀👀 let the anchor for your life be the Lord and not your emotions nor the standard that society/social media sets.
[14/2/18, 9:20:50 PM] Berwin ARROW: Rly needed that Ky :) it’s so good!!! Thank you 😭

[17/2/18, 3:23:34 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Attached are the list of youths (names highlighted in GREEN) who will receive the Camp Registration Link via NOAH on 20th Jan 2018.

All other youths will receive a Wish list link via their emails. They will be given 1 week to fill up the link should they want to appeal to go up for camp.
[17/2/18, 3:26:36 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: however when i looked through, some of the youths are not tagged to the correct CGs. can the leaders check the NOAH database and see if it is a problem just on this camp list or on NOAH as well? :)

either way, can 1 rep from SA and CJ edit the excel sheet so that the youths are placed in their correct CGs? can i have returns from you all by *Sun, 18 Feb 2359 hrs*? :) thank youuu

[20/2/18, 10:40:02 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hey guys, do yall know what the parable of the talents are all about? At first I went with the normal interpretation of "If you have a gift in xxx, then use it for His glory".

But I'm starting to realise that the parable of the talents is found after the parable the 10 virgins. The whole context is about the second coming of Christ.

The parable states that the one who buries the one talent he has is cast out into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.

So what does talents represent? (Matthew 25:14-30)
[20/2/18, 10:49:04 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Just curious, what made you think that talents == gifting is no longer accurate?
[20/2/18, 10:49:49 PM] Berwin ARROW: Ask in the bible chat leg
[20/2/18, 10:49:51 PM] Berwin ARROW: Leh
[20/2/18, 10:49:53 PM] Berwin ARROW: HAHA
[20/2/18, 10:49:57 PM] Berwin ARROW: This chat is for work
[20/2/18, 10:50:11 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okay wait ah
[20/2/18, 11:23:13 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hellooo, anyone having dinner before meeting tomorrow? ☺ at the star!
[20/2/18, 11:23:39 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I’ll be coming a bit late, about 7, but y’all can go meet without me!!
[21/2/18, 12:19:12 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hi official leaders in NOAH, do you all have the leaders info pack with all the details given to you all already?
[21/2/18, 12:43:19 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: hey guys, for your info, there's no leaders info pack (yet?). KJ will be helping us check with the camp comm on this 😄 (thanks KJ!!)

also, FA form should be sent out separately soon, you can start to think through which of your youths may need to apply for it :)
[21/2/18, 7:54:44 AM] Maxel ARROW: hey guys, i've just created a new email to upload all 700+ photos from arrow bash onto google drive ahahhaha it's uploading at the moment and it is every photo i took, unglams(jk y'all glorious), blurs, etc. included. y'all can take a look and save the photos.

[24/2/18, 3:34:02 PM] Kylie ARROW : Wild market
[24/2/18, 3:35:08 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Wild market might be a bad place because the guys had meeting there earlier on, music might be distracting for yall:)

[24/2/18, 10:41:06 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hellooo leaders ☺ hope men’s and women’s meeting and the post-service fellowship went well for you guys! Let me know how it went and if you have any feedback for the services :)
[24/2/18, 10:41:30 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Apologies for not giving a heads up earlier, there’s CG this coming week. Can we do it in the schools so that the freshies will be able to join? :) (we’ll be splitting them soon, probably after this CG) 

For the general direction, y’all can do either (1) Back to back community, or (2) Strong and spiritual culture (of declaring, the power of speaking). From Ps Dan’s sermon on 13 Jan Arrow. I’ll leave it to y’all :)  

Can y’all upload your plans by this Wednesday night?
[24/2/18, 10:45:53 PM] Kylie ARROW : Didn’t get to hear much feedback from the ground for the girls cos it was mostly the j2 girls stayed for dinner. It was good for them but the panel was too short.
[24/2/18, 10:46:41 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Mmhmm :) okay
[24/2/18, 10:54:59 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: When you mean do it in schools, do you mean like physically in school? Or like in CJ & SA?
[24/2/18, 10:55:19 PM] Kylie ARROW : Not physically!
[24/2/18, 10:55:37 PM] Kylie ARROW : So whole SA combined as one caregroup, CJ combined as their own caregroup
[24/2/18, 10:58:59 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Some of the feedbacks were: 
1) panel was too short
2) lack of proper structure (i.e. sometimes we might not know what we should ask)

The good:
1) refresher and some youths had take aways that they needed to hear.
[24/2/18, 10:59:06 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Ooh thanks Kylie!
[24/2/18, 11:05:17 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yup!
[25/2/18, 11:47:44 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hellooo leaders ☺ reminder to nominate your youths for the next run of Ambs! 👆🏻 the guidelines are in this message!

[26/2/18, 6:05:53 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: At this stage they just want to get to know you i suppose? Hear your bright ideas or what your thoughts are on certain things
[26/2/18, 6:05:55 PM] Megan ARROW: YAY

[26/2/18, 6:07:14 PM] Kylie ARROW : The first two interviews were the same two people
[26/2/18, 6:07:24 PM] Kylie ARROW : This one is with a different two people
[26/2/18, 6:07:51 PM] Kylie ARROW : So do I have to go through the same questions again since it’s different people I’m talking to?
[26/2/18, 6:10:03 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Nope, probably a different set of qns
[26/2/18, 6:10:15 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Sounds like a really high paying job

[26/2/18, 7:21:36 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: It might probably be diff questions.. but if it’s their first time meeting you they might not know what you’ve said in previous interviews!
[26/2/18, 7:23:03 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Anw at this stage if youve progressed this far, this round is probably for them to get to know you more & make sure you’re not crazy 😂 and for them to see if you’re a good fit for the company!!! ☺
[26/2/18, 7:50:58 PM] Vanessa: Congratulations Kylie!!!! ☺️🎉🎉🎉

[15/3/18, 1:09:31 AM] Kylie ARROW : Oh just update for those who weren’t around regarding cluster

Rach will plan worship
Vans will handle logs/slides

Every one else read the cluster message and send in your map answers *by 10pm on Friday*.

The prog is basically

- intro to activity 
- activity in small groups
- wrap up activity and CR share
- CG in small groups
- worship & closing

At the activities portion get them to answer the activity questions and sketch a map on the mahjong paper to identify where in Israel the 4 different stories happened. This will be done in groups of 3-4 depending on your CG size & number of leaders.

At CG time you split back into the same groups of 3-4 and cover the portions in the CGM labeled as breakout 1 and breakout 2 in that time. 

For the portion on Good Friday it depends on what your youths say so it may go in any of these directions
1. According to the CGM lol
2. No friend to bring - challenge them to ask the Lord for one / live life bigger than themselves / why evangelism /
3. No friend to bring - bring irregular
4. Whatever other direction la it depends on the level your youths are at also lol

@6596931493 @6597529151 @6597836744 @6598712012 

Acknowledged when you’ve read and raise any questions if you have!

This is for us to walk through what we’ll be getting the youths to do tmr, so that you’re better prepped to guide them! But also, it’s the joy of spending time in God’s Word luh and asking Jesus to show you things ☺

So it’s not to feel condemned if you didn’t find time to do it, but it’s just that you would have missed out on a portion and a time of feeding!

So yes i’d encourage you to run through it with yourself before cluster anyway:) enjoy being in His presence. have a good rest and I’ll see you tomorrow!!!

[30/3/18, 10:00:38 AM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: esplanade xchange*

[30/3/18, 10:18:12 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hi leaders I’m so sorry but...I woke up 10 mins ago 😭
[30/3/18, 10:18:21 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Will try my best to make 11.00am
[30/3/18, 10:18:42 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: But if I’m late.. start thinking of feedback for last cluster session haha
[30/3/18, 12:37:16 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey leaders! Just a reminder to try and get your CGs up early today ok😊🤙🏽there’s a dance item at the beginning and let’s be there to support them Okies!!!!!!!!✨
[30/3/18, 1:09:28 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: Cluster Feedback

Activity
- Message was a bit shallow. Could go deeper.
- Sense of community was there. Youths could be vulnerable with each other.
- Activity is more suitable for a longer period of time, given the amount of context needed to be known. So youths can glean more. Leaders already took quite a bit of time to prepare. Perhaps each group can focus on one story.
- Some youths did the activity just for the sake of doing it. It didn’t evoke any emotions in them. Maybe there was a lack of link between the activity and the message. Maybe the activity is not applicable in their life? 
- People can be left out in these kinds of activities. If youths are late, it’s hard to follow and process what the group is doing. 
- Maybe some prep is needed before CG to allow the activity to be more effective.
- Maybe the activity is better conducted in CG instead of cluster
Breakout
- Good because of real-ness in sharing (breakout #1) 
- Difficult to bring someone bc no one in mind; conversational topic go off (breakout #2) ——> but it’s okay, let life flow!! as long as the conversation doesn’t go toooo off, if it does then can jus bring it back
- Helped that there was a J2 there. It helped the J1s to open up. But it was hard to share deeply, it was quite brief/superficial. “O levels was my toughest point in life”. 
- It was a difficult environment for them to be real. They weren’t close enough to be willing to share the deep issues in their lives. 
- If there is one youth is willing to share more, we can talk more about that in the breakout, then the other youths can also catch/glean from that conversation. 
- Can do yes/no questions.
- Maybe not enough time to cover the 2nd question if someone cries. 
- Too big group = not enough time to cover breakout #2
- If breakout questions don’t prompt life-flowing-discussions, then open up a new qn that will facilitate more talking e.g. “so what does the lost, last and least mean to you?”
- Good that could pray for each other at the end of breakout
Worship
- First two songs good
- Worship at the start and end
- Prep the worship team to equip them = comes with time and building connections
- Communication to the youths serving is important; operational VS pastoral
General
- Try not to go over time but also be able to flow

[31/3/18, 12:47:28 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hey guys 🙂 

Wanted to give y’all a quick update abt my life!! Didn’t come for meeting yesterday, because I’ve been quite depressed (not suicidal) but abit sad (feeling sorry/pathetic for myself, at the same time being v hard on myself, and feeling very very paralysed all at the same time)

I’m rly sorry for not being there at meeting yesterday, just missing one meeting made me realise how impt y’all are to me haha and that I rly miss y’all!!

I’ve been declaring and speaking against the depression and going back to hear Him speak again. Essentially to keep myself in the love of Christ! Keep me in your thoughts and prayers, i would rly appreciate them 🙂

TLDR: I’m not good, but I’m getting better!! Love y’all
[31/3/18, 12:56:00 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: 🙆🏻🙆🏻 yasss, praying for you Berwin and we’re here for you!! 

I just feel like this reminds me of Elijah.. even when he wanted God to just take him out of life and out of his situation and struggles, God sustained him DAILY out of His mercy and love for him.. and Elijah went on to do great things still :)
[31/3/18, 12:56:31 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: So yes it shall just be for a season!! Which passes quickly!! And declaring that you shall encounter the love of God so tangibly even when you’re walking through this 🙆🏻

[1/4/18, 1:54:31 PM] Berwin ARROW: HAHHAA
[1/4/18, 1:54:38 PM] Berwin ARROW: btw*
[1/4/18, 4:17:22 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Sherrie, in the leaders chat we were told that leaders and PAS. are invited for the svc for baptism. Is there a link we have to sign up to rsvp for seat allocation purposes?
[1/4/18, 5:18:25 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I don’t think so :)
[1/4/18, 5:19:27 PM] Berwin ARROW: Does anybody have a recording of today’s svc :)

[2/4/18, 7:37:40 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: *South CG direction for 6/7 Apr 18*

Hi leaders!!! Thanks for patiently awaiting the CG direction for this week :) 

This week, CG is on *Jesus as our good shepherd* 😊😊
Main takeaway: _*Jesus is my shepherd, and I am taken care of. I am not alone.*_

Shepherd and sheep - it’s one of the depictions of our rs with Him that Jesus expounded on the most during His time on earth :) and to me it’s one of the most foundational things to us as believers :)

Also, seeing how it’s the week after evangelistic service and we wanna encourage our youths to invite back their friends whom they brought for service! It’s easy to digest, relatively low-barrier for NCs or NBs
[2/4/18, 7:38:02 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: *NOTE: this is the GENERAL direction, so you can choose the passages/facil questions/sharing, but for those who are NOT SURE, I will be suggesting possible directions and send smth more comprehensive later tonight :)*

Possible directions:
- How the Lord takes care of us (Psalm 23)
- Jesus as the GOOD shepherd (John 10:1-18, contrasted w the hireling)
- Hearing God in our lives (becuSe we are His sheep - John 10:27-28) 

Possible ending: although Jesus was our shepherd, He ended up being the sacrificial LAMB as our sin offering. Literally taking our place in this relationship. He knows what we go through and most of all, He took our sins so that we can take His place of blessedness.
[2/4/18, 7:38:30 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: To take note for CG this week:
- Invite back NBNCs and Vs who came for Friday’s service!
- If you have youths getting baptized this Saturday, it would be good if you can get the CG down to support! :) then possible to have CG right after that. 

Please send me your CG plans by Wednesday night 😊 you can leave your sharing portion generic for the moment if the details have not been confirmed yet. THANK YOU!!! Pls send an emoji to acknowledge that you’ve read this. 🦁 for SA and 🐏 for CJ ;)
[2/4/18, 7:41:25 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Oh ya and even for believers I think it flows nicely from Good Friday and resurrection Sunday - like now that Jesus has died and we are accepted into His fam, now what lol 

So we are His sheep lor :)
[2/4/18, 7:41:36 PM] Kim Lim: 🦁
[2/4/18, 7:45:51 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: 🐑

[3/4/18, 7:24:23 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey leaders!! Possible directions (suggestions) from me on how you can navigate within the topic of Jesus as our shepherd for this week’s CG :)
- can supplement with any other relevant verses/passages 
- design your own facil qns!

With all sharings and CGMs, the best are those that you have meditated and chewed on before :) the feeding is so much richer! 

So go with something that you have either meditated before or will be meditating on before CG 😊

Thanks!! Hope this helps!!!!! Let me know if you have any questions :)
[3/4/18, 7:24:53 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Soz for the extremely rudimentary form hahaha but wanted to get it to y’all asap

[8/4/18, 3:25:38 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: How was CG guys? :)

Some of y’all shared with me already but I think it’s good for y’all to hear from each other
[9/4/18, 8:47:03 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yoohoooo
[9/4/18, 8:47:16 PM] HFRyan ARROW: HAHAHAHHAHAHA
[9/4/18, 8:47:27 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Ill type mine out when im home
[9/4/18, 8:47:32 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Otw home rn
[9/4/18, 8:47:50 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Haha ok. Thanks Ryan 😁
[9/4/18, 8:48:03 PM] Kylie ARROW : Ooo sorz. Missed this.
[9/4/18, 8:49:50 PM] Kylie ARROW : My cg went so-so. It was a bit awkward and honestly felt like a new pastoral server again cos the conversations went everywhere but we covered what we planned which was to have them share what they wanted for the CG and we pinned it to a board. But The leaned in during the sharing which was great so cg was just soso
[9/4/18, 8:50:32 PM] Kim Lim: CG for SA A was really good, even though we had a very chill cg (more of fellowship and no facilitation) I felt that the Lord was really in the midst, worship just flowed naturally, everyone was sitting there worshiping. We initially wanted to create the opportunity for the J1s to relax and get to know the rest of the cg more but no j1s came 🙂 but believing for them to come next cg. Overall, cg started on time, short word was relatable to what we were doing and everything ended on time.
[9/4/18, 8:51:06 PM] Kim Lim: But what we could have improved on is the estimation of food. We didn’t get enough food, but thankfully Rachel’s parents cooked more food for us
[9/4/18, 8:53:28 PM] HFRyan ARROW: I seem to have a problem with estimation of food
[9/4/18, 8:53:33 PM] HFRyan ARROW: HAHAGHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
[9/4/18, 8:53:41 PM] HFRyan ARROW: #xmaspartyproblems
[9/4/18, 8:53:48 PM] Kim Lim: HAHAHAHAHAH
[9/4/18, 9:30:36 PM] HFRyan ARROW: CG was good-great for me, inbetween both. Bummer that the J1s didnt join us and Im working towards getting the J2s closer as one batch in my CG rather than 2 or 3 groups. Worship went well for me. The word was short and sweet plus the video was great. Not enough food but blessed by the host fam so it was Jesus ty for the supply. Yeap :)
[10/4/18, 9:19:02 AM] Rachel Koh: Sflr!! For mine it was in between good and okay cos the youths were being rly super vulnerable and open when they were sharing which was rly super awesome and they were encouraging each other sometimes also but the place we were at didn’t help cos the music was too loud so maybe i shd have moved to a quieter place. And my cg ended much later than what was planned but its okay the youths were okay w staying on :-)
[10/4/18, 9:23:57 AM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: CG was nubbad. Tim’s house was by far the most comfortable place we’ve had CG, but it was a bit ulu 🌚. I think the sharing + the video we shared was fresh and interesting for the youths so they were all pretty engaged. Worship was good too. Just a lil sad the J1s couldn’t join us.
[10/4/18, 9:27:38 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: My CG started off awkward, like a lot of awkward moments for myself. But everyone was willing to talk and share! We did an activity which kind if engaged them and they were more excited about it then anything else. We ended a lot earlier than expected, and the rest of the time spent was playing undercover and spaceteam. And they really opened up 😂 looking back should have started with a game lol! Only one J1 joined me. We had our CG at SMU teaparty.
[10/4/18, 10:22:31 AM] Kylie ARROW : LOL my plan was to play undercover and space team if i ended early but i ended on time 😂
[10/4/18, 10:34:03 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: We didnt have worship
[10/4/18, 10:49:30 AM] Kylie ARROW : ya i also didn't have
[10/4/18, 10:49:43 AM] Kylie ARROW : i think all the rabbit trail convos took up all the time 🤦🏻‍♀

What an amazing heart you have bb. to rmb and grieve for those affected. Yea let’s keep the families in prayer. *Death is not of God but He can use it.* :) He can use it to draw close to them. He can use it for them to know how much He loves them, and how great is His restoration 🙆🏻 Jesus’ finished work is greater than all these! And when Jesus comes back, He’ll set everything right and there will be no more deaths 🙆🏻

[16/5/18, 9:01:18 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: @6597300351
[16/5/18, 9:01:23 PM] Berwin ARROW: cos i rmb the consensus for cluster was that the person doing exhortation, should also do HC. cos always got awkward gap
[16/5/18, 9:01:31 PM] Berwin ARROW: right? :)

[17/5/18, 8:39:33 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: *Flow from middle to end of cluster*
Groups breakout
CR closing sharing 
Worship
Holy comm
CR closing prayer 

@6596931493 can work with @6585184665 for the transition from worship :)
[17/5/18, 8:39:39 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I think what happened last time was that the holy comm or exhortation ended abruptly because the speaker just stopped talking when they came to the end of their prepared part. and that segment was also at the end of worship, before CR sharing. (Someone correct me if I’m wrong) So we said it’s good to end in a prayer! Smoother, less abrupt 

this time I’ll be taking it from you, so can help w the transition. Anw there’s a clear end coz you’ll be telling them to throw their cups in plastic bags :)
[17/5/18, 9:04:09 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: I know there is Chloe.

[20/5/18, 10:04:17 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Hey south leaders! So right for years and years on end no JC cluster has won in camp💢😡😤. 
So this year JC has decided to team up🙏 and break that trend once and for all!!!!

With that in mind, from now until Camp, what we need to do is to :

1) ⚡Think about what will we (South) be doing for camp this year! Best would be for us to decide what the theme of our costumes will be & what our south cluster showcase will be *by Thurs* :)⚡

2) Recommend a total of *3 youths* to me for a *special item* (the combined JC effort)! they need to be able to commit🕕 to a rehearsal on 10th Jun, as well as be relatively free during camp (Not Emcee or Not Worship Something like that). Best would be people who can be expressive on stage! Being able to 🎬act/🎤sing/💃dance would be a bonus! 

3) Think of a *JC combined cheer*📣! If you got any youths who are like really good with cheers you can just let me know or delegate it to them to think of a cheer for the whole of our JC coalition

LETS WIN THIS GUYS

[21/5/18, 9:42:24 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: aw man :-( okay
[21/5/18, 9:43:51 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yeppppp and the youths can be close in your CGs and talk more in your CG whatsapp chats ☺ if got more people that they dk, they talk less
[21/5/18, 9:44:36 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I have no more view as to what is going on because the FTS have been rather quiet. But that should be the most updated because if any other youth signed up last minute, you will know or i would have seen the email in the inbox and i have seen none :)
[21/5/18, 9:45:14 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: yea i realised HAHAHA 😂 okie thanks for clarifying :,)
[21/5/18, 9:45:18 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: So would we be doing a cg chat or cluster chat
[21/5/18, 9:45:34 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Ooo still got updates to the list leh. Like got one guy in East not South, and one of megan’s youths pulled out of Camp alr
[21/5/18, 9:45:43 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Y’all can discuss within your school leaders:)
[21/5/18, 9:46:15 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hmm i think the FTS will release the camp list soon.
[21/5/18, 9:46:22 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: 👍🏻👍🏻
[21/5/18, 9:46:51 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Can i suggest than, that we create an individual chat group so that we can know for certainty who are going for camp?:)
[21/5/18, 9:47:28 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: It’s either CG or school chats now btw! Not cluster
[21/5/18, 9:47:34 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Can i remind all leaders to let me know the names of youths who pulled out?:) i will consolidate and email to the team under one email?:)
[21/5/18, 9:47:42 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Rogerrr
[21/5/18, 9:47:55 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I suggest CG chats for SA and school chat for CJ, but I’ll leave the decision to y’all :)
[21/5/18, 9:48:49 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I prefer cg chats but will want to align with ryan kylie and lucas:)
[21/5/18, 9:48:55 PM] Megan ARROW: Okies!!

[24/5/18, 10:20:40 AM] HFRyan ARROW: I kinda like the idea of every other electric superhero
[24/5/18, 10:21:42 AM] HFRyan ARROW: Then for those that wont be in a superhero costume we can have a standardise lightning uniform of sorts
[24/5/18, 11:40:10 AM] Megan ARROW: But we need everyone to dress up! Rmb last yr we only had a few ppl dressed up, it didnt really work out well haha
[24/5/18, 11:40:43 AM] Megan ARROW: So unless we group ppl up and then each group is one superhero, then they all dress to that one superhero
[24/5/18, 11:41:10 AM] Megan ARROW: Then maybe hv one who is the main hero, then the rest are that hero’s minions? But still similarly dressed!
[24/5/18, 11:41:39 AM] Kylie ARROW : Sherrie can be the main hero la then we can be whatever w the youths :-)
[24/5/18, 11:42:13 AM] Megan ARROW: But theres a few heros right related to electric
[24/5/18, 11:42:45 AM] Kylie ARROW : Yeah but if we do a few heroes then it’ll be like last year again right? That’s what you were suggesting to avoid?
[24/5/18, 11:43:26 AM] Megan ARROW: Eh as in, maybe like everyone dresses to one superhero, so its not just one person who’s the main hero, like its a group tgt!
[24/5/18, 11:43:27 AM] Megan ARROW: Does that make sense HAHA
[24/5/18, 11:44:02 AM] Megan ARROW: Okie so for eg right, like theres A B and C super hero, then one group dresses to A superhero, another group dresses to B superhero etc
[24/5/18, 11:44:32 AM] Megan ARROW: Idk does that make sense HAHAHA
[24/5/18, 11:44:36 AM] Megan ARROW: So we’re all dressed well
[24/5/18, 11:45:13 AM] Megan ARROW: So like based on last yr’s example, a group could hv been like the twins, another group could be the rabbit etc
[24/5/18, 12:35:27 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: If you need a villain i can be one 🙋🏻‍♂
[24/5/18, 12:37:47 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Yea HAHAHAHA
[24/5/18, 12:37:51 PM] HFRyan ARROW: I think thats not a bad idea
[24/5/18, 12:38:03 PM] HFRyan ARROW: But like I feel like the youths should be the super heroes?
[24/5/18, 12:38:12 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: HAHA
[24/5/18, 12:38:19 PM] HFRyan ARROW: And like we dress like sidekicks
[24/5/18, 12:38:23 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Or rather
[24/5/18, 12:38:29 PM] Megan ARROW: Ya omg i was actually thinking of that
[24/5/18, 12:38:30 PM] Megan ARROW: HAHAHA
[24/5/18, 12:38:33 PM] HFRyan ARROW: The rest will dress like sodekicks
[24/5/18, 12:38:39 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Thats what I meant
[24/5/18, 12:38:43 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: But we need some leaders to lead the youths luh
[24/5/18, 12:38:46 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: So maybe kne can be like a nick fury
[24/5/18, 12:38:46 PM] HFRyan ARROW: When I said everyone will be in a uniform
[24/5/18, 12:38:54 PM] Megan ARROW: Ahh okie
[24/5/18, 12:38:58 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: But youths be avengers
[24/5/18, 12:39:02 PM] Megan ARROW: Idk can just play around w these few ideas?
[24/5/18, 12:39:06 PM] Megan ARROW: Sherrie uh
[24/5/18, 12:39:08 PM] Megan ARROW: HAHA
[24/5/18, 12:39:08 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Lightning theme
[24/5/18, 12:39:19 PM] HFRyan ARROW: But ya how is that?
[24/5/18, 12:39:19 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Yeap yeap
[24/5/18, 12:39:29 PM] HFRyan ARROW: We can have cardboard costumes uh
[24/5/18, 12:39:32 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Instead of cloth
[24/5/18, 12:39:48 PM] HFRyan ARROW: For the main heroes
[24/5/18, 12:39:51 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Wont it be hard to manouvee?
[24/5/18, 12:40:01 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Then the rest os just dressed similarly with like a cape or smthing
[24/5/18, 12:40:12 PM] HFRyan ARROW: But wouldnt cloth be hard to do?
[24/5/18, 12:40:13 PM] HFRyan ARROW: HAHAHAHA
[24/5/18, 12:40:14 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Idk manz
[24/5/18, 12:40:28 PM] HFRyan ARROW: It would be easy to spot tho!
[24/5/18, 12:40:40 PM] HFRyan ARROW: And like pretty out-standing
[24/5/18, 12:40:56 PM] Megan ARROW: W more stuff HAHAHA
[24/5/18, 12:41:03 PM] Megan ARROW: Not just cape
[24/5/18, 12:41:04 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Definitey
[24/5/18, 12:41:12 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Agreed haha
[24/5/18, 12:41:20 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: But will look clunky
[24/5/18, 12:41:28 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Like last year acib all toasts
[24/5/18, 12:41:31 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Looks so clumsy hah
[24/5/18, 12:43:12 PM] Megan ARROW: Okie wait Ryan what exactly do u need by today uh
[24/5/18, 12:43:27 PM] Megan ARROW: Just to confirm the rough idea but we can still change a bit here and there right!
[24/5/18, 12:47:37 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Yeap :)
[24/5/18, 12:47:47 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Im just glad theres progres
[24/5/18, 12:47:49 PM] HFRyan ARROW: HAHAHAHAHA
[24/5/18, 12:47:55 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Cherry is scary
[24/5/18, 12:48:13 PM] Megan ARROW: HAHAHAHAHAHA
[24/5/18, 12:48:28 PM] Megan ARROW: Are we deciding on the final one
[24/5/18, 12:48:34 PM] Megan ARROW: Or letting the youths vote
[24/5/18, 12:48:55 PM] Megan ARROW: Cus rn they dont know the list of ideas
[24/5/18, 12:48:59 PM] HFRyan ARROW: I think superheroes is okay
[24/5/18, 12:49:03 PM] HFRyan ARROW: But we havent even devided
[24/5/18, 12:49:05 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Decided
[24/5/18, 12:49:13 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Which youths to be i  charge right?
[24/5/18, 2:06:26 PM] Kylie ARROW : Can someone do a TLDR
[24/5/18, 2:26:42 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: but wouldn’t superheroes be a bit hard? cause there’s not a lot of electricity heroes - i mean unless there is but i am not aware of them HAHA cause it’ll also be q sad if we give them heroes that nobody knows about....
[24/5/18, 2:27:05 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: True that.
[24/5/18, 2:29:42 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: i feel like it will be q funny even if we jus use like alumium foil and wrap/ paste on our clothes then we paint red blue strips on our limbs like u know those physics practical cables HAHAHA then at one point we can hold one another then everyone just ZZZSZSSSZSSZZZSZZ
[24/5/18, 2:29:54 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: so a standardised get-up for everybody
[24/5/18, 2:30:11 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: unless you want to clearly distinguish between leaders and youths then okay
[24/5/18, 2:30:27 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: we can have like batteries and switches and form a circuit
[24/5/18, 2:30:48 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Na, i dont think its impt too, i think the most impt is an electrifying performance
[24/5/18, 2:31:40 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: yeS okay HAHA
[24/5/18, 2:33:11 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: ((and sorry for not making reference to the suggestion list i acknowledge i saw it HAHAHAH))
[24/5/18, 3:30:05 PM] HFRyan ARROW: So we will be an electrical circuit board?
[24/5/18, 3:30:25 PM] Kylie ARROW : We don’t need a distinction between the leaders and the youths :-) I think we can go with rly cool appliances that light up or go ding when the electricity runs thru and it can be a musical!!! 🕺🏻💃🏻
[24/5/18, 3:30:28 PM] HFRyan ARROW: I know have la but ya true HAHAHAHA not all of them will be well known
[24/5/18, 3:30:41 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Ooo not bad
[24/5/18, 3:30:42 PM] Kylie ARROW : Like the smart local’s Carlsberg ad
[24/5/18, 3:30:46 PM] Kylie ARROW : Idk what it is called
[24/5/18, 3:30:56 PM] Kylie ARROW : Like yknow when one person start tapping or drumming
[24/5/18, 3:31:04 PM] Kylie ARROW : Then another one comes in rhythm
[24/5/18, 3:31:08 PM] HFRyan ARROW: But ya definitely no need distiction
[24/5/18, 3:31:15 PM] Kylie ARROW : LIKE POTTERPUPPETS
[24/5/18, 3:31:50 PM] Kylie ARROW : https://youtu.be/Tx1XIm6q4r4
[24/5/18, 4:54:47 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: omg thiS HAHAHAHAHA
[24/5/18, 7:46:20 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Guys im gonna be abit MIA coz of my presentation. But isit alright if we decide if we are gonna be appliances, superheroes or electrical boards by tonight 😂
[24/5/18, 10:45:28 PM] Kylie ARROW : Superheroes is too mainstream let’s cancel it out
[24/5/18, 10:45:49 PM] Kylie ARROW : I vote either appliances or electric board
[24/5/18, 10:46:04 PM] Kylie ARROW : If it is appliances there is the possibility of an electric chair
[24/5/18, 10:46:08 PM] Kylie ARROW : LOL
[24/5/18, 10:46:46 PM] Kylie ARROW : The theme song for tierney to dance to is electric shock by f(x)
[24/5/18, 10:47:03 PM] Kylie ARROW : He either gets shock at the intro or at the end 🕺🏻
[24/5/18, 10:51:36 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: rt
[24/5/18, 10:51:44 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: yes to this
[24/5/18, 10:52:09 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: or the electrical chair can be for sherrie?? ahahhaha
[24/5/18, 10:53:22 PM] Kylie ARROW : Ok then Sherrie has to get shocked
[24/5/18, 10:53:24 PM] Kylie ARROW : LOL
[24/5/18, 10:54:36 PM] Kylie ARROW : Voting for non super hero cos the top last year were the space theme one and the kaya toast one.
[24/5/18, 10:54:48 PM] Kylie ARROW : So we should just go for something innovative lel
[24/5/18, 10:55:45 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: So sounds like a dance performance?
[24/5/18, 10:59:25 PM] Kylie ARROW : It doesn’t necessarily have to be dance, it can be each group of appliances consistently making one sound and they will come in one after another to MAKE A SYMPHONY LALALA
[24/5/18, 11:03:36 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: so it’ll be an acapella type performance?
[24/5/18, 11:08:17 PM] Kylie ARROW : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eFwTXovt4A
[24/5/18, 11:08:19 PM] Kylie ARROW : like this but live!!
[24/5/18, 11:08:27 PM] Kylie ARROW : idk what dyou call this when you do this live
[24/5/18, 11:09:24 PM] Kylie ARROW : yknow that thing where one person starts clapping then someone else claps in another pattern then someone else whistles and someone else drums and it all becomes one whole symphony idk how to explain
[24/5/18, 11:09:27 PM] Kylie ARROW : do i make sense LOL

[28/5/18, 12:56:54 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys, I did up a packing list for AV Camp, feel free to send it out to your CGs! ☺

[28/5/18, 1:14:44 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Haha 👍🏻
[28/5/18, 1:14:50 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks Megan 😊
[28/5/18, 2:14:27 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Also guys!! Some of us were talking over dinner yesterday and we were thinking of changing our cluster identity to ELECTRIC POKÉMON!!!! ⚡⚡🦊🐥
[28/5/18, 2:15:50 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: So like each CG has an electric Pokémon to dress up as (or 2 share 1 Pokémon if not enough Pokémon) and we create a narrative or smth with a gameboy interface (to be played as a video) and the CGs acting it out at the same time!
[28/5/18, 2:20:14 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Okay some funny suggestions that were thrown up ytd (but we need to revise them hahaah)

“Sherrie uses mercy” “it is super effective!” “HP x2 / Youth evolve to Core youth / etc etc”

Maybe can have a battle w a dark type Pokémon also and we win!! Like yknow battle against the forces of darkness hahha

~“Sherrie uses correction” “CGL uses bitterness / CGL evolves”~
[28/5/18, 2:21:00 PM] Megan ARROW: 🙂 No worries!
[28/5/18, 2:21:10 PM] Megan ARROW: And okie!

[8/6/18, 2:05:06 PM] Kylie ARROW : ‼️‼️ *CHANGE IN CAMP DEPARTURE POINT* 🤨🧐

Hi guys! We have received news on Tuesday that the Trump-Kim meeting has been confirmed to take place on 12 June and the Singapore Police Force has released an official announcement with regards to areas that have been cordoned off for security reasons. Harbourfront Cruise Centre has been marked as one such area. 

For more details:
www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20180606_others_Declaration_of_the_summit

In view of this, we will be shifting our departure from ~Harbourfront Cruise Centre~ to 
*BIG BOX (1 VENTURE AVENUE, SINGAPORE 608521).* 👈🏼❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

Meeting times and departure times *will remain the same*. The arrival venue for our return trip from Sunway to Singapore *remains at Harbourfront Cruise Centre* and estimated arrival times remain as stated in your briefing notes! 😉

Will send to y’all an updated doc after camp comm sends it through to better understand the changes in the departure procedure with details on how to get there. 😎

Send a 💃🏻 when you’ve noted this!

Previously this was an unspoken rule but as of last month they SAF made it a standing order~ 😊

This is just in case you are found with it at Malaysia customs and held back for unnecessary questioning

PS not from me ah it's from somewhere above 😛

[9/6/18, 11:48:04 PM] Kylie ARROW : I realised I got no NSFs going for camp
[9/6/18, 11:48:08 PM] Kylie ARROW : They ord alrd lol
[9/6/18, 11:48:14 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hahaha
[9/6/18, 11:48:20 PM] Kylie ARROW : But ya ok mb it may be relevant for the three CGs
[9/6/18, 11:48:34 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks for bringing it up still Kylie!! I think it is still important and it still stands!
[9/6/18, 11:48:58 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Lemme double confirm
[9/6/18, 11:49:12 PM] Kylie ARROW : Okie thankssss
[9/6/18, 11:51:20 PM] Megan ARROW: Yes HAHA i got one youth who POPs tmr and he’s going for camp 🙂
[10/6/18, 12:56:37 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Can someone explain to me how would the customs know who brought an 11b and who didnt?
[10/6/18, 12:57:04 PM] Kylie ARROW : Idk hehe
[10/6/18, 12:57:23 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Okay thanks thanks will tell zephan
[10/6/18, 1:10:04 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Guys wanna play angel and mortal for camp?
[10/6/18, 1:10:13 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Like we facilitate for the youths
[10/6/18, 1:10:17 PM] Loocurse ARROW: It's like secret penpal
[10/6/18, 1:10:37 PM] Kylie ARROW : OOOOO SOUNDS GOOD THO
[10/6/18, 1:12:24 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahaha I can facilitate!! @6581002833 sounds gud?
[10/6/18, 1:12:33 PM] Loocurse ARROW: We can get them to write notes maybe every dinner or what
[10/6/18, 1:12:44 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I am actually do it for my cg already
[10/6/18, 1:13:24 PM] Megan ARROW: Omg sounds good!!
[10/6/18, 1:13:40 PM] Megan ARROW: Across the CGs?
[10/6/18, 1:14:14 PM] Kylie ARROW : Let’s do it on a school level for CJ and CG level for SA. Sounds good?
[10/6/18, 1:15:26 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I thought cluster level is good!
[10/6/18, 1:15:35 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Because if its too small group then v easy to guess
[10/6/18, 1:15:39 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Then it'll kill the vibe
[10/6/18, 1:15:54 PM] Loocurse ARROW: The anon feel must be strong hahaha
[10/6/18, 1:16:06 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Eh i think SA level easier because cross cluster is hard to know who is whi
[10/6/18, 1:16:21 PM] Loocurse ARROW: True also
[10/6/18, 1:16:31 PM] Loocurse ARROW: But can see it as a way for them to get to know each other
[10/6/18, 1:17:01 PM] Megan ARROW: Yea actually might be good
[10/6/18, 1:17:08 PM] Kylie ARROW : We should go with CG level for SA since one of our goals for camp on our side is to bond the youths at CG level.
[10/6/18, 1:17:13 PM] Megan ARROW: Cus then you give them chances to know ppl within the cluster
[10/6/18, 1:17:32 PM] Kylie ARROW : Then CJ can bond on a school level since they’re stronger on a CG level but not on a school level
[10/6/18, 1:17:38 PM] Megan ARROW: But tbh angel mortal wont rly be bonding?
[10/6/18, 1:17:53 PM] Megan ARROW: Its more of getting to know the other person
[10/6/18, 1:18:09 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: My version would be: writing notes and like serving one another
[10/6/18, 1:18:50 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Serving one another?
[10/6/18, 1:19:14 PM] Kylie ARROW : Like take food for one another ah
[10/6/18, 1:19:18 PM] Kylie ARROW : ?
[10/6/18, 1:19:48 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Yea
[10/6/18, 1:19:51 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Or drinks
[10/6/18, 1:19:52 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Or whTever
[10/6/18, 1:19:54 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Or pray
[10/6/18, 1:19:55 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Haha
[10/6/18, 1:20:58 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Oh so it's not rlly an anonymous thing?
[10/6/18, 1:21:17 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I was thinking having the anon feel will make the game more fun, like the suspense of finding out their angep
[10/6/18, 1:21:45 PM] Megan ARROW: Yea that sounds fun haha
[10/6/18, 1:21:47 PM] Kylie ARROW : It’s still anonymous lu!
[10/6/18, 1:22:04 PM] Loocurse ARROW: But how to serve anonymously?
[10/6/18, 1:22:04 PM] Kylie ARROW : They can write notes and do things in a less suspicious manner
[10/6/18, 1:22:06 PM] Megan ARROW: This one abit like buddy system where they know who is looking out for who
[10/6/18, 1:22:07 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: It is, i told them to be discreet and ninja about it
[10/6/18, 1:22:16 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Oh right I see hahaha
[10/6/18, 1:22:20 PM] Megan ARROW: Quite hard uh HAHAHA
[10/6/18, 1:22:29 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I think writing notes still can
[10/6/18, 1:22:32 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Serving a bit hard ah
[10/6/18, 1:22:35 PM] Megan ARROW: Esp when its directed to one person only
[10/6/18, 1:22:35 PM] Kylie ARROW : Can one la I play in a small group before
[10/6/18, 1:22:55 PM] Kylie ARROW : They will be prayed for by so many people at camp how will they know which one is their angel
[10/6/18, 1:22:58 PM] Megan ARROW: As in the serving part?
[10/6/18, 1:23:05 PM] Kylie ARROW : Pastor pray for them then Pastor their angel
[10/6/18, 1:23:07 PM] Megan ARROW: Eh no not praying LOL the serving aspect!!
[10/6/18, 1:23:10 PM] Kylie ARROW : ??
[10/6/18, 1:23:10 PM] Megan ARROW: HAHAHAHAHA
[10/6/18, 1:23:13 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I let them try, all about ttying and failing
[10/6/18, 1:23:16 PM] Megan ARROW: No no not the praying
[10/6/18, 1:23:19 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Or succeeding i hope haha
[10/6/18, 1:23:23 PM] Kylie ARROW : Serving can one la
[10/6/18, 1:23:34 PM] Megan ARROW: I meant like the serving, i think writing notes more discreet
[10/6/18, 1:23:36 PM] Kylie ARROW : In the end confirm got people just take food for the whole table
[10/6/18, 1:23:48 PM] Kylie ARROW : So they will be confused
[10/6/18, 1:23:49 PM] Megan ARROW: HAHAHAHAH no i dont think so 😂😂😂
[10/6/18, 1:23:59 PM] Megan ARROW: Okay maybe SA will
[10/6/18, 1:24:00 PM] Kylie ARROW : Well quite sure for the SA side it’ll be so la
[10/6/18, 1:24:05 PM] Megan ARROW: But idt CJ side will LOL
[10/6/18, 1:24:12 PM] Kylie ARROW : Like they will just take desserts for every one
[10/6/18, 1:24:18 PM] Kylie ARROW : Or get teh tarik
[10/6/18, 1:24:37 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Haha
[10/6/18, 1:24:44 PM] Megan ARROW: Ohya more so for supper
[10/6/18, 1:24:47 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I will try and let yall know
[10/6/18, 1:24:48 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hahaha
[10/6/18, 1:24:51 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Could be many things
[10/6/18, 1:26:56 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahaha aye okay so CG level or school level?
[10/6/18, 1:27:12 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Ky I think for our CG still can, we so big LOL
[10/6/18, 1:27:40 PM] Kylie ARROW : Ya our CG can do on CG level
[10/6/18, 1:28:03 PM] Kylie ARROW : But it’s still possible to do it on a small group level like with KJ’s CG
[10/6/18, 1:29:42 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okies
[10/6/18, 1:29:45 PM] Kylie ARROW : And it’s different knowing one other person from the cluster vs one other person from the CG. Since we want tighter CGs for SA side then we can afford to do angel-mortal at CG level for SA. And it’s easier for the youths la since the interaction is within themselves
[10/6/18, 1:30:03 PM] Kylie ARROW : As compared to me having to give teh tarik to some person from CJ that idk
[10/6/18, 1:30:20 PM] Kylie ARROW : If I do that game over alrd
[10/6/18, 1:30:25 PM] Kylie ARROW : Cos so obvious lol
[10/6/18, 1:30:40 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I'm just scared they will bust their identity too early, then it's not fun alr
[10/6/18, 1:30:48 PM] Loocurse ARROW: ^for smaller cgs
[10/6/18, 1:30:58 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Lol
[10/6/18, 1:31:31 PM] Kylie ARROW : I think our youths are smart enough la hehe
[10/6/18, 1:44:24 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okies then we just do CG lvl then
[10/6/18, 1:44:32 PM] Loocurse ARROW: @6598428694 ill settle it!
[10/6/18, 2:09:01 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Sounds good!!!
[10/6/18, 2:09:15 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hahah KJ’s CG is small but he got no problem doing I
[10/6/18, 2:09:16 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: It
[10/6/18, 2:09:43 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Itll be me and mah boos
[10/6/18, 2:09:45 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Bois*
[10/6/18, 2:10:30 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Must learn from Ryan and his bois
[10/6/18, 2:11:24 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: And the food part sounds doable!! They can secretly take dessert while their mortal is taking food. Then put on the table with a note saying it’s for their mortal ;)

[10/6/18, 6:06:15 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: For me, I’m activating my M1 data passport. So I use my local data quota but overseas. Costs $10 to activate I think. I prefer it coz more reliable and less likelihood of failure. I think some SIM cards last min couldn’t work in previous years

The Lord loves you, He approves of you. Anything that you do, the enemy will find any way to attack you for it. So rest in the Lord’s love today ☺❤ the fruits are given from Him, the glory goes to Him. You produce good fruit by resting in Him. And I believe that there is good fruit from you but you just don’t see it. So I pray a new rest over you, and in your ministry. Amen ❤

[17/6/18, 11:34:17 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey south shepherds, thank you for your labor of love the past 5 days!!! ☺❤✨ the way you loved on the youths, taking time out for them, having those needful conversations with them, sharing your heart with them, rallying them together, encouraging them, were all so amazing!! I salute you 👏🏻 and I believe these were all carriers of the Lord’s amazing love for them toward them!!

I am so floored by what the Lord has done, that they stepped out and had words for each other and they heard from the Lord from each other!!! What a generation we’re raising! Let’s bring this spirit from Camp back into our entire CGs!!! 

Thank you all for ALLOWING the Lord to use you, AGREEING to be part of His plan to raise this generation of youths. Stepping out of your comfort zone and making personal sacrifices to be used by Him. Let us be a leadership that continues to seek Him, hear from Him, and most of all *be loved by Him* and in that, become great and mighty in doing what He has called us to do. There is so much more, and I pray that your heart is strengthened by Him, the work of your hands are blessed, and that you will continue to see the miracles of Camp in your daily life! The Lord reward you richly for what you have sown into His kingdom 👊🏻 amen!! LOVE YOU GUYS!!!
[17/6/18, 11:40:11 AM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: Woohoo amen PTL!!! Thank u Sherrie, I’m really so greatful that the Lord has chosen you and placed you as the leader and shepherd over our lives!!! The Lord will surely reward you even more richly for what you have down into His kingdom and our lives :)))) love u Sherrie!!! Have a restful week ahead gaisss

This is very important as we are generating stats on retention and most of all, we want to ensure that together we report accurately so that we can plan ahead accordingly for the rest of the year and the next batch that’s coming in 😊

Additional note: for those schools with more than one cg, do check if the freshie is tagged to one cg and therefore may not have attendance taken by the other cgl.

So if you got prayed for, you go pray and send a prayer to another person okay!! Continue the prayer chain within 24 hours!
[11/7/18, 5:59:21 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: And you can defs pray for more than 1 person at a time :)) shall we do it together?? Hehe

[21/7/18, 12:15:05 AM] Vanessa: Amen!!!!!
[21/7/18, 12:17:42 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Anyway, random but this verse spoke to me:

“Brethren, do not be children in understanding;
however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be mature.”
‭‭I Corinthians‬ ‭14:20‬ 

The Bible calls us to be babies in malice, but to be mature in understanding!!

I don’t rly have an exposition on it LOL but it just speaks to me. and I’m amazed that it was my first time ever seeing this verse this past week

(This is after paul’s rather long exposition on why interpretation of tongues and understanding (which produces prophecies) is preferable to only speaking in tongues.)
[21/7/18, 12:18:58 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Ok after a bit more chewing I think, maybe paul is trying to say, put in any of your energy and effort into understanding the things of God (and therefore growing in it), rather than on finding fault and differences with other people 😊 Don’t be children in understanding. Be mature in understanding. And be babies in malice. Wooo
[21/7/18, 1:04:35 AM] Kylie ARROW : http://thir.st/blog/so-you-didnt-like-the-sermon/

Reminds me of thissssssss. Talks about questioning our intentions when we discover faults and poses a good question to ask ourselves too - are we out to contribute to the unity/edification of the body of Christ or is our questioning just an ego boost.

[22/7/18, 12:12:35 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I saw from my friend’s insta story that Taya Smith (newly married 😄) had a panel/sharing on relationships recently!! It was at Unplugged (Hillsong young adults service on fri nights). hahaha I asked my friend to send me her notes!!

Here they are:

God has to be the centre of your relationship or marriage - this is non-negotiable

Submission test:
- Sacrifice your needs - put their needs (the person you wish to pursue) above yours and see if that person submits back
- submission doesn’t have to mean one party is more superior than the other. Equal submission fosters respect and trust 
- If they are abusing this submission test then they aren't the one

Dating/marriage:
- Respect each other's time for God 
- Motivate each other to grow more
- Don't let your feelings get the best of you
- Guard your heart (proverbs 3:4)

Single:
- Hold on to the promise that God has for you, don’t hold on to an ideal 
- Ask God for a promise regarding your future spouse
- Psalms 15-16
- Trust the season you are in
- Feelings aren't facts
- You might feel frustration but don't miss out on what God is doing in your life when you are single
- Don't ever settle for the second best
- The right person can't come in when the wrong person is in your life

Past:
- If you have dated other people before and have done things that make you think you've gone too far, just know that by the grace of God you can be redeemed
- Don't cut yourself out from God
- We serve a God of freedom and truth. Be real and vulnerable with Him
- The word of God brings life, fullness, restoration, healing

So don't live as per what the media would tell you to do. You live your best and to the fullest when you live as per god's word

[29/7/18, 10:12:16 PM] Kylie ARROW : btw if y'all haven't read the CGM yet it's a love attack CG guys! If you have core youths or youths who are super onz for evangelism kind of thing can rope them in early to plan w you.

[31/7/18, 8:30:10 PM] Kylie ARROW : Hi guys there is an NCC’s leaders meeting for appointed CGLs and Pastor prince will be there. PS if you have any burning questions that are *leadership related* please list them and we’ll try to ask them:

- How do we create a safe space for youths to talk about controversial issues OR
- How do we create a safe and welcoming space for youths who struggle w controversial issues feel like they can open up about controversial struggles (LGBTQ+, pro-choice, etc) bc the bible is v clear on these issues so it’s easy for people to feel condemned and outcasted when they fall into these categories

[31/7/18, 8:39:46 PM] Loocurse ARROW: eh walao
[31/7/18, 8:39:54 PM] Loocurse ARROW: kaijie
[31/7/18, 8:39:56 PM] Kylie ARROW : KJ should we be concerned about that question hehe
[31/7/18, 8:39:57 PM] Loocurse ARROW: stay eh
[31/7/18, 8:40:14 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: It is a legit question i always am wondering. 🤷🏻‍♂
[31/7/18, 8:40:18 PM] Kylie ARROW : Romans 5:3-5 😛
[31/7/18, 8:40:22 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: HAHA
[31/7/18, 8:40:29 PM] Kylie ARROW : Ok but yes it’s true
[31/7/18, 8:40:35 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I mean esp for pastor prince himself
[31/7/18, 8:40:40 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: When would he hand the baton over
[31/7/18, 8:40:47 PM] Kylie ARROW : Need to always be sensitive to when God is leading us somewhere else and not to stay comfortable where we are
[31/7/18, 8:40:58 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Not saying get rid of him, but it js a legit question.
[31/7/18, 8:41:04 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Ya lor
[31/7/18, 8:41:08 PM] Loocurse ARROW: who will be the next senior pastor
[31/7/18, 8:41:13 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: HAHAH
[31/7/18, 8:41:14 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Idea
[31/7/18, 8:41:27 PM] Kylie ARROW : HAHA
[31/7/18, 8:41:42 PM] Kylie ARROW : I think he has always been moving from one area to another behind the scenes
[31/7/18, 8:41:50 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Perhaps
[31/7/18, 8:41:59 PM] Kylie ARROW : Like esp w building the church to church management to not managing
[31/7/18, 8:42:33 PM] Kylie ARROW : It’s just that throughout all these we only see him on stage all the time so it just looks like he is in one place only
[31/7/18, 8:43:29 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I dont think he does all that
[31/7/18, 8:44:00 PM] Kylie ARROW : As in all these were prob when the church was small
[31/7/18, 8:44:12 PM] Kylie ARROW : And when I was half in a sperm and half in an egg
[31/7/18, 8:44:17 PM] Kylie ARROW : 🤓
[31/7/18, 8:44:26 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hahaha that analogy
[31/7/18, 8:45:51 PM] Loocurse ARROW: omg so weird to think that y'all were once SPERMS
[31/7/18, 8:46:08 PM] Kylie ARROW : That was all humanity lucas
[31/7/18, 8:46:39 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: But i am like wondering: in varsity service we always talk about handing over the baton to the new generation. In Arrow we talk about raising leaders and people who will take over NCC one day. BUT in genrev we hear nothing like that. There is a disjoint. So how then do we handover the mic? So what does it really mean to let the new generation rise up? In Arrow and Varsity the foggiest idea would be to be the one preaching (like Lucas 🎉🎉) instead of Ps Dan or Ps Darren. But for main church? Is it some one from genrev? Haha so many legit curious questionssss
[31/7/18, 8:47:14 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: The first example when two become one
[31/7/18, 8:52:36 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Oh right yeah that's interesting

- How do we raise youths who are on fire for God and for the gospel of Grace
[31/7/18, 8:52:53 PM] Loocurse ARROW: oh yeah do you think it's biblical to let non-pastors speak on stage hahaha
[31/7/18, 8:53:15 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Ehhhh i think no, but i have no verse for that in mind.
[31/7/18, 8:54:22 PM] Loocurse ARROW: 2 Timothy 5:21a

"Only let the brethren you appointed speak.."
[31/7/18, 8:54:46 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Nice!
[31/7/18, 8:56:20 PM] Loocurse ARROW: hahaha
[31/7/18, 8:56:23 PM] Loocurse ARROW: that's fake
[31/7/18, 8:56:24 PM] Loocurse ARROW: LOL
[31/7/18, 8:56:27 PM] Loocurse ARROW: PSYCHED
[31/7/18, 8:56:45 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hahaha clearly i havent read enough bible
[31/7/18, 8:56:49 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: 😛
[31/7/18, 8:57:02 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Need to read more, that is my motivation
[31/7/18, 8:57:16 PM] Loocurse ARROW: to be able to distinguish fake verses
[31/7/18, 8:57:43 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hahaha na to discern when Lucas is telling a joke or not
[31/7/18, 8:57:45 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Jkjk
[31/7/18, 9:00:57 PM] Loocurse ARROW: LOL
[31/7/18, 10:24:36 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Orh hor misuse the favour that God give you
[31/7/18, 10:26:51 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hmmmm how long have we been in genrev to be able to make that kind of statement? And to be fair genrev leaders just came back from a leaders retreat so maybe they’ve talked about that! 😊

actually (from the few times I’ve been to genrev service) I’ve seen a variety of leaders going up to share (whether testimony or facilitate a panel) or do exhortation. And there are a few new overseers in the past 1 year :))
[31/7/18, 10:27:26 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Pastor Vegard is super release-the-mic-and-let-others-speak 😂
[31/7/18, 10:27:43 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Is your qn more about PP being the senior pastor for many many years? :)
[31/7/18, 10:28:20 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: What’s the background of your question of moving to another ministry actually? :)
[31/7/18, 10:32:15 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Haha aww man, i dont mean to be making it intense! Have been going to genrev since i was in V.

But genrev is a great place! No doubt about it. I can tell you more in person because typing through text might misrepresent me haha.
[31/7/18, 10:32:42 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Haha oops soz for the onslaught of questions, just wanted to find out more
[31/7/18, 10:32:52 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: They just seem like very different questions!
[31/7/18, 10:34:00 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Maybe they’re just not super explicit about talking about raising the next generation? But I do see it in their actions, or at least glimpses of it :)

No la im not saying that you’re saying it’s a bad place ☺
[31/7/18, 10:34:19 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Yeap i agree
[31/7/18, 10:34:27 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Anyway good to hear your thoughts :)
[31/7/18, 10:34:32 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Do share them!!
[31/7/18, 10:34:53 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: LGBTQ is also something I’m thinking of asking
[31/7/18, 10:35:02 PM] Vanessa: ^
[31/7/18, 10:35:15 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I think i’d share in person, texting can be misrepresenting me: and i dont wanna be kicked of ministry because of bad conduct lol 😂😂😂 jkjk
[31/7/18, 10:35:27 PM] Vanessa: How abt take a video!

[31/7/18, 11:05:04 PM] Vanessa: 👍🏻😂
[31/7/18, 11:10:34 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahahaah wah i think it's a good question but idk if anyone would have the guts to ask pastor prince that
[31/7/18, 11:10:48 PM] Loocurse ARROW: It's like the prodigal son asking for his inheritance (somewhat) hahaha
[31/7/18, 11:33:31 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: haha maybe what you see now may not be the most indicative of what the next generation that comes forth from gen rev will be, especially since we have the Lord. it's great to have practical steps in raising the next generation but we shouldn't discount the fact that our Abba wants to keep us well fed and led, so whoever is part of the next generation by His grace is sure to be amazing
[31/7/18, 11:34:12 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: hope i didn't say anything wrong hahaha 😅, and looking foward to what pastor's reply is if u get the chance to ask 🌚

[5/8/18, 6:21:08 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey south leaders 😊 we’re on the lookout for ✨✨DG BUDDIES✨✨ for this year’s Arrow Integration!!

Each DG will have a JC DG buddy. There are 18 DGs and 6 JC clusters. As such, we’ll be sending 3 youths from South cluster to be DG buddies! 
(This is separate from DG rep which will be one of you...an arrow has already been shot 😄)

Could you think about it & nominate your youths pls? 😊

Will leave it to y’all to sort out how many from SA and how many from CJ 

MORE INFO:
they will be the first POC for DARE youths. Priority for youths who went for AI. Traits would be love the Freshies, good ambassadors of the house, ideally would take care of the CG when the leaders are away 

IMPT DATES:
9 Sep
25 Nov
15 Dec 
12 Jan 
19 Jan 
The dates we want our dg buddies to be able to commit to.

[15/8/18, 11:14:00 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: @6598428694 @6597836744 just wanted to share one takeaway from tonight cos y’all pontang (heh 🌞 we love you guys):
Just as how Jesus asked the Samaritan woman to give Him a drink, a part of our reaching out to His lost sheep is simply about letting them know that they are valued, and that they have something to give/offer.
[16/8/18, 12:02:19 AM] HFRyan ARROW: And for me was how nearing these end times what is important is for us to have fervent love for people
[16/8/18, 12:27:14 AM] Kylie ARROW : 👍🏼
[16/8/18, 6:40:37 PM] HFRyan ARROW: HI ALL!!! Heres the link to Tierney's and My idea for precluster welcome!

[17/8/18, 1:40:11 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: hahaha
[17/8/18, 5:22:12 PM] Berwin ARROW: Do our youths know abt love Attack this Sunday ah?
[17/8/18, 5:46:48 PM] Vanessa: Waa good question. I don’t think so eh
[17/8/18, 6:53:27 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I don’t think so!! Will be plugging it at cluster session

Probably coz they need the leaders more, for manning the connect points

Thanks for raising it @6596931493 !
[17/8/18, 6:53:52 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Helps me frame it when I talk about it to the youths tmr
[17/8/18, 8:22:38 PM] Berwin ARROW: Should we inform our youths about Sunday’s love attack through our CG channels before cluster? :)
[17/8/18, 8:23:15 PM] Berwin ARROW: Also did y’all sign up to serve on Sunday! Or y’all plan on rallying the youths to attend tgt?
[17/8/18, 9:41:43 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Sure :)
[17/8/18, 9:42:16 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yas pls go sign up and serve!! See Brod’s message on the Arrow leadership chat :)
[17/8/18, 11:06:22 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hey guys I was thinking of the flow tmr. Have we tried making them sit down to have holy comm.  So after my exhortation ill get them to sit down (still with the music in the bg) and ensure that everyone has the elements. Then I'll quickly introduce erisa and Naomi to lead them
[17/8/18, 11:06:39 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Wdyt
[17/8/18, 11:09:00 PM] Kylie ARROW : We haven’t tried that w cluster but perhaps that would be good
[17/8/18, 11:09:19 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I am always up for trying something new:)
[17/8/18, 11:09:43 PM] Kylie ARROW : I think we should think of the transition part like how we distribute the holy Comm cos I think it’s usually that part is disruptive
[17/8/18, 11:11:10 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hmm I was thinking of ending of my exhortation with smt like "give jesus the praise clap clap" then I'll tell them we r going into a time of holy comm and once you've received your elements you can take a seat
[17/8/18, 11:11:19 PM] Loocurse ARROW: So that we know who haven't receive also
[17/8/18, 11:11:33 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Then in the process I'll introduce erisa and naomi
[17/8/18, 11:40:39 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: sounds like a good idea!! @6597836744
[18/8/18, 2:19:45 PM] Berwin ARROW: Are we meeting earlier to pray? :)
[18/8/18, 2:21:34 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Obviously never read the CGM plan

If you’re reading this, welcome to Berwin’s 24th bday gathering!! I’ll be having a super chill gathering at my place this coming Saturday, on the 25th

It’ll be after arrow service and approximately from 8pm -10pm 

TLDR:
1. Just come as you are :-) no dress code, no obligations. Also we might have worship! Rach Lee and maybe Lucas, I love y’all 
2. Don’t bring presents (unless you wanna buy me an iPad Pro + Apple Pencil/ Kindle)
3. There will be pizza and coke!!! So keep some stomach space if you have dinner before coming over 

If some chill fellowship is up your alley, then just click on this link so I know you’re coming and how much pizza to buy!! Hope to see you there 🍔

[27/8/18, 8:20:13 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey leaders! 😊 thanks for all your super prompt responses with the attendance comments! Also, since I didn’t get to see y’all on Sat, here are some admin things:

1. Packing of Youth Rally goodie bags
2. Ambs nomination
3. Invite core youths for 12 Sep Arrow leaders meeting 
4. Leaders retreat 5-6 Oct

I’ll be sending the relay messages respectively!! Please see for deets 😊
[27/8/18, 8:21:32 AM] Kylie ARROW : 👍🏻
[27/8/18, 8:24:01 AM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: 👌
[27/8/18, 8:25:38 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: 1. Packing of Youth Rally goodie bags

The team really needs help packing 12000 goodie bags :) do ask your youths if they wanna help out! The packing will be on Tue, Wed, Thur, 10.30am-6.00pm at the star! 

And they can just go for whichever time slot they’re free! :) even 1 hour would be appreciated. 

I think a google form will be sent out soon, but if you want you can do an informal call and submit the names and availability to Alicia first :) THANKS GUYS!!
[27/8/18, 8:26:12 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Random announcement: RSVP here for seats at 2nd service on 2 Sep to shout Ps Judah Smith down!! 👉🏻 http://bit.ly/2SEPJS lets all go together?? 😄🤙🏻
[27/8/18, 8:27:21 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: 2. Ambs nomination

Ambs batch 5 is coming to a close and so we will be starting the process for the nomination of the next batch of Service Ambassadors ✨⚡✨ 

(On a side note, thank you so much for sending your youths to ambs for the last 2.5 years! They’ve been such a blessing to the ministry!)

We would need the submission of names latest by *9th September*! The following will be a rough guide and reminder of what Service Ambassadors are about and hopefully this will help!

🍭 an ambassador is *a point of connection*, the first face your NB/NC meets
🍿 an ambassador represents your cluster (hence they should be regular and connected with the CG)
🍰 Commitment level: *every service for 6 months* (starting from 29th Sept)

Much appreciatez to have their names, NRIC, and phone number sent in (to this number) by *9th September*!! 

_Number of Ambs needed per cluster_
JC South(3)
[27/8/18, 8:28:22 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: 3&4.

No CGM - you can think of how to ride on youth rally and today’s/tomorrow’s message, to do something catered for your youths! 

If they just finished exams can go do something different/fun-ish 🎉

[3/9/18, 6:52:06 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Thanks Kylie!
[3/9/18, 9:10:13 PM] HFRyan ARROW: Noted!
[5/9/18, 2:43:52 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hi leaders \😊/ Megan asked me about POST-RALLY and I thought I’d share here as well!

_*“Now that rally is over, what do I do?”*_

1/ first off, just wanna say THANK YOU for serving! And next, *every life is precious!!!*

2/ the keyword is *FOLLOW-UP*. You can:
• Ask youths who brought friends: how was rally for them and their friends?
• If you managed to connect with their friends and they’re comfortable sharing, you can also ask them yourself!

3/ if your youths’ friends are New Believers,
• Woohoooo!! 🎉 Talk to them and your youths about where they’re at, how they feel about the decision, any concerns/worries?
• *Invite them back to join us!!! 😊 #Southisfamily*

4/ if your youths’ friends were visiting from another church,
• If they are rooted in their home church, the door is open for them to visit anytime, But we generally won’t heavily encourage them to come again (lest we be seen as sheep stealers 😛)
• If they are not rooted in any church, *Invite them back to join us!!! 😊 #Southisfamily*

5/ again, *every life is precious!!!* and it really forms the basis of why we do what we do. hopefully the above is useful and practical? Wanna encourage you guys to be *bold* and *diligent* to follow up 😊 and by doing this, you are carrying Jesus’ heart for them and for “the one”!! Thank you for serving!! 🔥❤

“The *memory* of the righteous is *blessed*”
“The mouth of the righteous is a _*well of life*_”
“The *labour* of the righteous leads to *life*”
“The tongue of the righteous is _*choice silver*_”
“The lips of the righteous *feed many*”
“The *hope* of the righteous will be *_gladness_*”
“The lips of the righteous know what is _acceptable (favourable, pleasurable)_” 

Amen!! 🔥☄💥

[12/9/18, 9:12:41 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hi frens :) culture starts from us as leaders. I know some of our youths aren’t rly “core core” yet and are even here for the first time. Still we can encourage them to be bold and do things out of their comfort zones☺
[12/9/18, 9:16:43 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yas :)
[13/9/18, 11:04:03 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hey guys, i just want to share my takeaways from Nehemiah 3😊, because i won't be present on the 15th of Sept. 

Admittedly Nehemiah 3 had been and will always be a boring chapter to me because it is just names and more names. And perhaps someone of Ps Prince’s calibre will be excited at the hidden meaning of names or how it all pieces together (like the lineage of Adam).

But yesterday’s reading opportunity allowed Jesus to open up my eyes and see👀 beyond just name and more names and really apply it to the ministry. So, here goes:

So the chapter begins naming people from different backgrounds. They were leaders, sons of sons of sons of some random person, the priests and also family units. Also, there were people who weren’t skilled in constructions helping out as well. There were goldsmiths, merchants and perfumers...etc.  So first we have it, no matter the background nor experience, there is a part that we can all play in Arrow. Next, I read that not everyone just built walls. They built doors, towers, stairs…etc. Arrow cannot survive only on people who are standing on stage or cgls or those who are in ops running the weekly services. Arrow is what it is today because of the youths who have a far greater reach, an impact in their social circles; something that neither platform ministry nor the ops can reach out to.. And that is the beauty of it. What is the point of cgls if there are no youths. What is the point of the preacher/music ministry/ops if there are no audience/service to run. 

The one thing i noticed is the repetition of “and next to them” & “after him”. And that really seals it for me because we are in this together. we serve side by side. I am next to Lucas as much as Lucas is next to Kylie..and the chain goes on all the way to Ps Dan who is next to Ps Prince. Also “after him” spoke to me in the sense that we are not alone in our respective ministry. For example, Ryan and Rachel serve side by side in SA A. But with Ryan leaving, SA A still has Rachel. So in that sense, there is continuity? That the ministry will (and i pray) that it will never reach a point that there is just no continuity. 

The last thing that jumped out at me were ‘daughters’ being mentioned. Like the last NCC leader’s meeting one lady asked if there was a place for women in the ministry. Yes and a thousand times yes. Like in the house of God there is no gender discrimination. Women are as impt as the men are (our CR is female and the one heading the JC cluster is a female as well woohoo!🎉)

Of course what intrigued me is the way they describe the method of fixing the doors: “with its bolts and bars” 🔩which i am still pondering about. And also Lucas shared something about the order of the gates mentioned has a symbolic meaning to a Christian’s life (you can ask him cause i barely read it)

Hope my sharing wasn’t too long lol😅
[13/9/18, 8:08:54 PM] Kylie ARROW : SO GOOD
[13/9/18, 8:14:04 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: Noiceeeee preach it bruv (btw I couldn’t help but read it in your voice hahaha)

Which is quite amazing because it meant that the Lord took notice and recorded according to how they did it! Even if it seemed insignificant and was just part of a larger wall:)
[14/9/18, 11:38:26 AM] Char ARROW: Hi! I have a Varsity friend, Vans, who told me she met a CJ girl who wants to attend arrow :) She will be accompanying her to the next service:-) she wants to get her connected after.

[16/9/18, 11:41:16 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: hey guys!! as spoken at yesterday's meeting... here is the allocation of roles amongst ourselves as south leadership 😄

the intent of it is to give greater clarity of roles for each of you, and also strengthen us as a leadership and a cluster (for the youths) by having a dedicated person overseeing each of these areas ☺

so let's be praying, and in the coming weeks you can run by any plans or the vision you have for the component under you with me ☺ every one of them is impt!!

and you can always ask me any questions k!!

love you guys, and like we studied in Nehemiah, let us "have a mind to work" and build our walls, until the enemies feel threatened!! wooo

*CG plan* in (with details) by *Tue 2 Oct* 😊 

If you need to talk to me about it, ie your core is not super confident of organizing, or how to bring your core to the next level, pls let me know!! We can do a phone call or smth if the timeframe is a bit short

[5/10/18, 2:14:25 PM] Megan ARROW: Hallo guys I checked the fastest way to get to Cherryloft Resorts without walking too much (cus this heat is so bad), hope this helps yall!! ☺

Nearest MRT: Pasir Ris MRT station
Take bus 354 from Pasir Ris Interchange
Alight at the 3rd bus stop (name of bus stop is Lighthouse)
Theres a small lane if you walk against traffic from the bus stop (Jalan Loyang Besar), just follow the lane in and Cherryloft Resorts is around the corner! The distance to walk isnt so far, its like walking across SMU Campus Green so shouldnt be so bad 🙂

[19/10/18, 8:34:50 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey guys! Yesterday while worshipping I had a picture of golden anointing oil running down our heads and flowing down to cover the rest of us. 

And it was a picture of how, just like oil greasing a machine and making it run smoother, anointing from God brings in divine favour, divine shalom, and divine wisdom. And all these will oil what is in our hands

So if you feel stressed recently or find things very rough and abrasive to deal with, just wanna proclaim that His anointing on you shall make all things run supernaturally smooth 😊 depend on His divine ways coz it will take you further (and leave you in a better state) than what your natural strength can do for yourself! Let’s say in our hearts “I can’t do it without you, Jesus”!!
[19/10/18, 8:38:41 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Praying for your interview for uni today @6590174449 !!! Christ in you the hope of glory ☺🌟

[1/11/18, 7:05:37 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Wow just saw this and thought to share it with you guys ☺ following our recent fellowship over “compromise”!! So good! It is often so subtle, the posture and trust of our heart shifting from dependency on God to other natural things.

Encourage y’all to do the activity we left off with - which are the areas of your life do you think you’ve compromised on? Whether through fear, physical frustrations, convenience, or “I think I know better”. What are God’s actual promises for these areas? 😊

Let’s not settle for anything less than what God has for us 😄 I pray that there will never be a spirit of “status quo” amongst us but we will press in and inherit all He has promised us! Amen!

Can yall fill up this list by this thursday please! Thanks thanks!!
[12/11/18, 7:48:48 PM] Rachel Koh: And I’m not sure yet but we might have worship in the program so maybe don’t ask those who are serving in cluster worship!
[12/11/18, 7:49:38 PM] Rachel Koh: And at the same time, can help me ask ard if any of the youths are able to open up their house/function room on the 22nd!! Can pm me if there’s anyone!
[12/11/18, 7:49:41 PM] Rachel Koh: Thanks guys!!
[12/11/18, 7:49:46 PM] Kylie ARROW : Could you give us some dates that we can provide our youths with if they ask what is the commitment like
[12/11/18, 7:50:19 PM] Kylie ARROW : Like when planning will officially start for them, how often do they have to meet you f2f or on skype.
[12/11/18, 7:50:38 PM] Kylie ARROW : Or an estimate would be fine - like let’s say meet once a week.
[12/11/18, 7:50:52 PM] Kylie ARROW : This will help when the youths ask how much time they have to commit 🙂
[12/11/18, 7:59:16 PM] Rachel Koh: I was thinking of meeting them once on a weekday (maybe next week depending on availability) to intro them to each other, their roles etc like a more formal start!! 

After that its really up to each team to decide how often or how they want to meet to discuss. But from what happened last year, the games and decor ppl had to meet up/skype to discuss more, while the food people were busy only nearing the party itself

I’ll ask them for meetups along the way to check their progress and stuff but that can be done on a sat like service or cluster so they don’t need to take time out on a weekday
[12/11/18, 8:00:02 PM] Kylie ARROW : Okie can :-) thanks rachhhh
[12/11/18, 8:00:32 PM] Rachel Koh: Welc welcz wuhu

[17/11/18, 11:53:34 AM] Vanessa: Hi guys :-) was thinking for later right, to ensure that the flow is good, we could *give out the HC elements to the youths when they enter*, and ask them to *hold onto it during worship*. (Maybe before worship starts, the worship leader could remind the youths to hold onto their holy Comm), so that we won’t have to disrupt the flow by giving out HC elements halfway through. 

One more thing, the *collection of the empty HC cups*, could I get maybe 2 of you to help w the collection? I’ll bring some plastic bags to pass to y’all. When we finish with HC, can just *promptly move into the youth crowd to collect the cups*. That’s about it hehhe thanks!!
[17/11/18, 11:55:34 AM] Rachel Koh: Okayy got it thanks joo yang

[6/12/18, 12:29:38 AM] Kylie ARROW : It’s at East Coast
[6/12/18, 8:01:59 AM] Rachel Koh: Oooo okay
[6/12/18, 8:03:08 AM] Rachel Koh: Okay kj’s helping me ask odele if her place is available so we wait for her to reply first?
[6/12/18, 8:03:36 AM] Rachel Koh: If not then we east coast uh
[6/12/18, 8:19:37 AM] Megan ARROW: HAHAHA
[6/12/18, 8:19:43 AM] Megan ARROW: Thanks Sherrie!! ✨
[6/12/18, 8:39:41 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey leaderssss, just a heads up, we’re considering moving Christmas cluster to *22 Dec* instead of 29 Dec. this is because of the office claims system where all claims have to be submitted by 23 Dec, which will affect whether we can make adhoc purchases on event day, like food. 

The number of youths affected is a handful, about 5. 

Does anyone have any issue to raise if we move it to 22 Dec? :) (or any creative ideas on how to bypass the claim dilemma)
[6/12/18, 8:41:39 AM] Megan ARROW: Actually if we use the budget before 23 Dec we’ll be able to claim early right? Like for decor, ordering of food, venue payment. If they’re confirmed before 23 Dec, we can claim first?
[6/12/18, 8:43:43 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yup can, provided we can get the invoice before 23 Dec. I think the main concern (that we can currently think of) is food!
[6/12/18, 8:43:48 AM] Rachel Koh: But for food they can only order and get the receipt on the day itself or maybe a few days earlier so if we have the party on the 29th the claims date would have passed alr
[6/12/18, 8:43:57 AM] Rachel Koh: Ye the food
[6/12/18, 8:45:49 AM] Megan ARROW: Hmm i think can try asking them for softcopy invoice tho? Cus when you order food early you’ll pay for everything when you order (idk whether thats for all caterers tho, can check)
[6/12/18, 8:55:35 AM] Kylie ARROW : Caterers probably can order earlier.
[6/12/18, 8:56:30 AM] Kylie ARROW : If we’re using Odele’s place, the function room fee will probably take the bulk of the budget, if I am not mistaken, it’ll cost $120 for a 6 hour block of time.
[6/12/18, 8:58:38 AM] Rachel Koh: The food team isn’t planning on catering tho like some suff they getting from zichar store then other stuff they prep themselves
[6/12/18, 8:58:56 AM] Kylie ARROW : I get that office has their restrains and that it may only seem like 5 youths but let’s prioritise the youths over the claims thing and find a way to work around this. Doesn’t make sense to bring the party date forward over administrative stuff.
[6/12/18, 8:59:37 AM] Rachel Koh: Oh srs then the past few times we used her function room also so ex?
[6/12/18, 8:59:42 AM] Kylie ARROW : Some zichar food can order from caterers. Let me find the zochar contact for you.
[6/12/18, 8:59:52 AM] Kylie ARROW : Yeah
[6/12/18, 8:59:59 AM] Kylie ARROW : Still need downpayment also
[6/12/18, 9:00:27 AM] Kylie ARROW : Ok mb it was $60
[6/12/18, 9:00:34 AM] Rachel Koh: Okay thanks ky I’ll ask the food team to replan  some of their stuff
[6/12/18, 9:00:48 AM] Kylie ARROW : Then after the party the condo will return $60 from the $120
[6/12/18, 9:01:31 AM] Rachel Koh: Wah that’s still q ex too but okay wait for Odele to reply on availability first
[6/12/18, 9:01:44 AM] Kylie ARROW : https://order.shifuge.sg/en_SG/
[6/12/18, 9:02:30 AM] Kylie ARROW : Can ask the youths to Google for zichar online also, there’s zichar delivery popping up here and there nowadays.
[6/12/18, 9:03:16 AM] Rachel Koh: Okiee
[6/12/18, 9:08:56 AM] Kylie ARROW : Mb can book staples or enough food to claim from budget before 23rd then the rest they can buy on the day itself.
[6/12/18, 9:42:23 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: the goodluck garden function room booking is only $60! and of that $60, $30 is the deposit so essentially the booking fee is only $30
[6/12/18, 9:48:44 AM] Kylie ARROW : Yeah but for the timing we’re looking at it’ll overlap into two time blocks so it’ll end up being $60 for booking and $60 deposit.
[6/12/18, 11:05:55 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: ohh so must book two slots ah :-(
[6/12/18, 1:13:15 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Ok thanks guys for your inputs and thanks Kylie :)
[6/12/18, 1:29:45 PM] Kylie ARROW : Yeah for hers need to book two slots!
[6/12/18, 1:30:02 PM] Kylie ARROW : Cos the planning youths need to come in earlier to prep
[6/12/18, 2:49:35 PM] Rachel Koh: Btw sherrie can joo yang and i take 2 of these :-)
[6/12/18, 2:49:56 PM] Rachel Koh: Ye :-)

Thank you for continually choosing to be here, moving as a team, bearing my armour even when at times it felt heavy to, and faithfully following the Lord 😢🙆🏻‍♀

Our best days are ahead of us!! Yay to 2019 where we’ll GATHER, GROW and GIVE.. and step into ALL that the Lord has for us in our ministry and in our own lives ☺ amen!!

[27/1/19, 12:40:28 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey Rach! Yes it should still be on, coz arrow team night is for arrow servers (non-pastoral, like service ops, etc) and the event is open to any youths who are interested to start serving! 

Leaders are not required to attend, but y’all can go down to see who amongst your youths are interested to serve
[27/1/19, 12:41:16 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: The Arrow Ministry cal is currently not updated; it doesn’t have Zone Team Night on 13 Feb (as per debs’ msg in arrow leadership chat) inside also

[28/1/19, 12:18:25 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hi Kylie! Yas thanks for asking
[28/1/19, 12:18:54 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: CG 2 FEB 2019

Objective(s):
• (1st objective by CGLs, depending on your CG topic)
• To welcome the freshies!

Options for CG topics:
1. Bible study on church theme of the year (Year of the Latter Rain)
2. Bible study on South cluster vision
3. Visioning (bible stories like Abraham; passages like Habakkuk, Ezekiel 37...)
4. Anything within Arrow’s 4 C’s (Christ, Culture, Community, Conqueror)

Pointers:
• Have some activity or program that can help break the ice betw seniors and freshies! 
• Definitely have breakout into smaller groups; if having any combined sharing (like by one leader to the whole SA/CJ, to keep it to 15 mins :) 

Reminders:
• Get the freshies’ names and contacts
• Invite them back for 9 Feb
[28/1/19, 12:20:34 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: ^ the guidance for 2 Feb CG

I thought of typing out facilitation questions but those would rly depend on what your CG topic is... so I’ll leave that to y’all k, anyway y’all can already 😎

The main principle is to get them to share about their lives, and if it’s a bible study, to also have a qn on application! Eg how does this look like in my life?

[16/2/19, 1:46:37 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys, for those who are late/coming later, heres a bunch of directions for yall to get to Tanjong Beach on your own!!

1. From Harbourfront MRT, take the escalators up to H&M. Walk past H&M towards the atrium (H&M should be on your left and Tangs on your right), towards the exit of Vivo. Take the exit and walk out, you’ll see the boardwalk on your left.
2. Take the boardwalk all the way in
3. Once you reach the end, turn right and walk straight
4. Take the second last exit (there should be some restaurant there i think its a seafood place) and cross the bridge over the mini river, you should see the Food Street on your right.
5. Walk past Food Street and you’ll see Universal Studios on your left
6. Look for the monorail station, it should be right across from where you entered, so from Food Street, head towards the outlet thats ahead of you (you should walk past this fountain area after Universal Studios, the monorail station should be on the right)
7. Take the monorail to Beach Station (make sure you’re taking the right direction and not back to vivo hahah)
8. Once you alight at Beach Station, when you head down, you shld be exiting via the left
9. When you exit the monorail station, turn left again and you should see some shops, i know there’s a Gelato place and Old Chang Kee is there as well, you’ll also see some buses there
10. There should be a road on your left, cross over (can take the zebra crossing), and there shld be a tram station there (metal bars are there for the queue)
11. Take the tram to Tanjong Beach!!!
12. Once you have alighted at Tanjong Beach, walk away from the Tanjong Beach Club towards this grass area thats facing the sea, you should see us there near the Pavilion area!
[16/2/19, 1:46:51 PM] Kylie ARROW : Thanks Megs

[21/2/19, 1:23:26 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Yeah I was thinking of Tevin too!
[21/2/19, 1:38:03 PM] Berwin ARROW: I’m good with it :)
[21/2/19, 3:16:03 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: “Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.”” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭10:21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

We know the story of Jesus and the rich young ruler. We know what the ruler asked and how Jesus replied. It ended with the young men walking away sad for he was a very rich man. 
As a reader, we would not know tone Jesus used to speak to the rich young ruler. Just imagine Jesus saying this: 
“One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.”
Quite a tall order and can be really demanding from an observer’s perspective. But yet the Holy Spirit beautifully went to the extent of documenting the manner of how Jesus did it. The bible says that Jesus looking at him and  loved him. Why this matters so much because when we serve, in essence we gave up “something” to follow Him, (time, opportunities, energy). But yet when Jesus called for the ruler to follow him, he did it out of love. Jesus loved him. The ruler wasnt another spare human being for Jesus plan, Jesus love him! Jesus loves us, you and i.

Apart from that, it taught me a leadership principle of engaging youths. It is not just about what we say but the style on how we carry it out and what we feel on the inside. Jesus didnt have to look at the ruler, bible didnt have to explicitly mentioned that Jesus loved him (i am sure Jesus loved everyone, yet there was a special mention). I know we cant be like that right off the bat, but let’s pray for the Grace to be involved when we speak to the youths or in any case, just about anybody.

Just wanted to share something from my reading with you all 😊
[21/2/19, 3:29:50 PM] Berwin ARROW: That’s good :) thanks kj

[25/3/19, 9:41:58 PM] Kylie ARROW : @6581002833 do we tell camp comm to split the freshies for us too?
[25/3/19, 9:49:57 PM] Megan ARROW: Ohyes i just asked her abt this, can compile into an excel spreadsheet then email to her! Remember to password lock the excel doc!
[25/3/19, 9:53:16 PM] Kylie ARROW : So we sent one to camp comm and one to Sherrie?
[25/3/19, 9:53:19 PM] Kylie ARROW : *send
[25/3/19, 9:53:27 PM] Megan ARROW: Just send to Sherrie first
[25/3/19, 9:53:40 PM] Kylie ARROW : The camp one send to Sherrie?
[25/3/19, 9:54:03 PM] Megan ARROW: As in you're doing one to split for camp also?
[25/3/19, 9:54:23 PM] Megan ARROW: Like a overall split one then specific one for camp?
[25/3/19, 9:54:49 PM] Kylie ARROW : We have to write separately for camp and NOAH
[25/3/19, 9:55:05 PM] Kylie ARROW : For NOAH it’s all the youths so that one is clear that it’s to send to Sherrie.
[25/3/19, 9:55:30 PM] Kylie ARROW : For camp we’ll split as well right? Since the freshies are in the list under A for both sides.
[25/3/19, 9:57:37 PM] Megan ARROW: Oh i dont recall sending one for camp last yr
[25/3/19, 9:57:56 PM] Megan ARROW: But ye camp one gotta split as well!
[25/3/19, 9:58:10 PM] Megan ARROW: OH i know why i didnt write last yr hahah cus all the freshies going up were gonna be w me
[25/3/19, 9:58:12 PM] Kylie ARROW : I think because we split a month earlier last year!
[25/3/19, 9:58:36 PM] Kylie ARROW : Ok I guess that too HAHAHA
[25/3/19, 9:58:46 PM] Megan ARROW: oreally?? HAHA okok then we just do a camp one as well i guess, maybe @6581002833 can let us know if we send to camp comm directly?
[25/3/19, 9:59:28 PM] Megan ARROW: But makes sense for us to send to camp comm directly right since the changes must be made by Wednesday?
[25/3/19, 9:59:37 PM] Kylie ARROW : Megs you split the CJ side in the camp list then send to me? Don’t need to CC camp comm.
[25/3/19, 9:59:45 PM] Kylie ARROW : Then I’ll compile all the changes
[25/3/19, 9:59:51 PM] Kylie ARROW : And send one email to camp comm
[25/3/19, 9:59:56 PM] Kylie ARROW : So that they just get one email
[25/3/19, 10:00:03 PM] Megan ARROW: Can can! Thanks Ky!
[25/3/19, 10:00:06 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Kylie i send you when i get homr
[25/3/19, 10:00:08 PM] Kylie ARROW : Cos SA side apart from the freshies we have some changes that need to be made too.
[25/3/19, 10:00:28 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I want to add jianhui and jon taylor under my list
[25/3/19, 10:00:36 PM] Kylie ARROW : This one no rush, tmr also can. Cos the one I asked you for was for the NOAH split. Not the camp split.
[25/3/19, 10:00:38 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Andrew and bebin on hold?
[25/3/19, 10:00:54 PM] Kylie ARROW : Ok wait the NS guys we discuss in our SA chat.
[25/3/19, 10:01:40 PM] Megan ARROW: Ahh okok, CJ side just has the freshies, send it to you in a bit!
[25/3/19, 10:14:58 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey Ky sent to you!
[25/3/19, 10:15:25 PM] Kylie ARROW : Got it!
[25/3/19, 10:22:05 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks Kylie for organizing and consolidating!

Yes, we should send in a list for camp groups to the camp comm asap, we did this last year too, around this time. I was the one who sent it in. 

A separate list for CG splits for NOAH should also be submitted to Arrow admin. This one will come into effect at a delayed time because the Arrow admin will only split CGs in July, after camp 

And yup, SA NS guys wise, only JH and JT for now :)
[25/3/19, 10:22:50 PM] Kylie ARROW : Okay, so Andrew will remain with SA A for camp?
[25/3/19, 10:23:44 PM] Kylie ARROW : Does this also mean that we don’t need the NOAH split list yet? So we can wait until after you’ve talked to the remaining NS boys before we work on the list.
[25/3/19, 10:23:58 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: I think best to keep him in SA A first for this list that we’re submitting
[25/3/19, 10:24:04 PM] Kylie ARROW : Okie
[25/3/19, 10:25:02 PM] Megan ARROW: Noted! Anyways sherrie the NOAH split one i alrdy emailed it to you!
[25/3/19, 10:26:39 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Ok! thanks Megan 😊
[25/3/19, 11:04:13 PM] Kylie ARROW : Okay we’ve submitted our changes
[25/3/19, 11:06:19 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks Kylie!

[30/3/19, 1:22:49 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: hey leaders ☺ blessed saturday! for next week's CG, we'll be doing another culture CG on one of the 4C's; More than a Conqueror! the suggested CG outline for it is already in the list of CG outlines shared with you. you may build on it or edit it to suit your CG:) the key passage is Romans 8:31-39.

am believing that it will be a blessed time as you prepare cuz the Lord will show you what it is to focus on for your youths. and as you go through the Word, the Word will go through you!, and sustain you for those of you gg through a hectic period in school/work.

do remind/prime the youths on Good Friday evangelistic service happening on 19 Apr :) 

as usual, CG plans to be in by Tue 2 Apr in our google drive :) thank you!!

“I returned and saw under the sun that—
The race is not to the swift,
Nor the battle to the strong,
Nor bread to the wise,
Nor riches to men of understanding,
Nor favor to men of skill;
But time and chance happen to them all.”

[23/4/19, 11:43:49 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: hey leaders! am looking for nominations for the next batch of ambassadors to serve in the ambs team. this time it will be a *1-year cycle*.

will be looking for 2 youths from each school, so 4 in total from south! please raise the names to me by *6pm tomorrow (Wed)* :) 

i think it would be good to consider the following: heart for the house, heart for the Lord, heart for people, interest to serve, teachability, availability, and the spirit that they carry :) strong serving teams make for power-packed arrow services!! 

thank you leaders!!
[23/4/19, 11:44:24 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: the numbers for each school are flexible, so if you feel that you have more/not enough, no pressure, just raise it to me too :)

[25/4/19, 7:24:42 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Thanks Lucas! Hmm treasure hunt will take an hour is it? :) I had the impression it will be over quite fast.. like 20-30 mins
[25/4/19, 7:24:46 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Can correct me if I’m wrong
[25/4/19, 7:27:23 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I think we can vary the time depending on how we want the rules to be. But i think we had a 5 min explanation, 30 min treasure hunt, 15 mins to confirm if everything is found, 5 mins to call everyone back and 10 mins buffer. Anyhow, even if we end early, there's food ready so we can dive right into the next program
[25/4/19, 7:28:02 PM] Loocurse ARROW: wait i realised those numbers don't add up but yeah change it to a 5 min buffer hahaha
[25/4/19, 8:06:10 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Btw the NS guys, should we ask them to come later, it's a bit of a mockery to give them 3 hours to start serving right hahaha and somemore we got 2 pits
[25/4/19, 8:06:36 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Should we ask them to come at 5.30 instead? I think it should be fine
[25/4/19, 8:06:58 PM] Kylie ARROW : NS guys cooking right
[25/4/19, 8:07:12 PM] Kylie ARROW : @6581002833 dyou have oil brush and metal tongs at home?
[25/4/19, 8:07:15 PM] Kylie ARROW : If not we will buy
[25/4/19, 8:08:13 PM] Kylie ARROW : Actl, ya, if the NS boys not playing the game then let them cook from 530 - 730 instead
[25/4/19, 8:40:27 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: yeap i think this is better too

4. You can choose to walk past the bus stop and up the hill (the sheltered walkway) or walk along the HDB blocks
5. As you walk straight, just before the condo, turn right. If you took the sheltered walkway, you’ll need to take this orange stairs down and you’ll see this space + a badminton court. If you’re walking along the HDB blocks, turn right when you see the orange space.
6. As you walk towards the badminton courts, there should be a preschool on your right.
7. On the left of the badminton courts, there is a back gate.
8. *Call any of the leaders once you’re nearby and we’ll pick you guys up from the back gate!*

VERSE 1
Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me
CHORUS
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I’m a child of God
Yes I am
VERSE 2
Free at last
He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me
CHORUS 2
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I’m a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father’s house
There’s a place for me
I’m a child of God
Yes I am
BRIDGE
I am chosen
Not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me
Not against me
I am who You say I am
[27/4/19, 8:10:04 PM] Loocurse ARROW: As You Find Me

Hillsong UNITED

I've been strong
And I've been broken within a moment
I've been faithful
And I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together
And watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath

I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there

I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
But somehow
You love me as You find me

Who am I
To think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord
Take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious
And I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing
And still You want my heart

I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
You wear the scars
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
But somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

Your love's too good to leave me here
(You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
(You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
(You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here

If You want my heart
I won't second guess
‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me

If You want my heart
I won't second guess
‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me

If You want my heart
I won't second guess
‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me

And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
But somehow
You love me as You find me

If You want my heart
I won't second guess
‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me

If You want my heart
I won't second guess
‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me
[27/4/19, 8:10:05 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Another In The Fire

Hillsong UNITED

There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me
There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow
To the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

There is no other name
But the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen
And this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that's where You'll be

I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that's where You'll be

I'll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that's where You'll be
I'll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that's where You'll be
I'll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that's where You'll be
I'll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that's where You'll be

Hi guys, here is the CGM for your reference first to have an idea of the objectives and the theme.

I haven’t reorganised the sharing yet cos it was actl from a past CGM in 2016 for a bible study kind of breakout. But I’m repurposing the breakout for cluster sharing.

The breakout questions are not finalised so you can ignore that portion first because they were from the 2016 CGM. I’ll be discussing with megs and berwin tonight more questions late at night. Will share with you guys the questions by tmr so y’all can tweak for your CGs.
[15/5/19, 12:06:07 AM] Megan ARROW: Hellu South girls, reminder that tmr is at *PTC* HAHA ☺☺ See yall tmr!
[15/5/19, 12:06:47 AM] Kylie ARROW : @6597836744 can check if Andrew is free

[29/5/19, 9:12:04 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Okay
[29/5/19, 9:12:05 AM] Kylie ARROW : If you wna do on behalf of the youths then make sure to get their info with their consent
[29/5/19, 9:20:12 AM] Loocurse ARROW: But I think u shld do it for them because i not sure if all of them got singpass
[29/5/19, 9:20:35 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Then it'll be equally mafun to troubleshoot their problems than just asking for their next of kin
[29/5/19, 9:21:17 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: I didnt know you can register on their behalf without their singpass
[30/5/19, 11:33:52 AM] Megan ARROW: Hellu!! This is regarding the MFA registration that was mentioned at the camp briefing that day. If you werent at the camp briefing, we are required to submit some details to MFA about our travel but this yr, the camp comm admin team is not able to do it on our behalf, so we’ll be submitting it tgt as a CG! For that, would need yall to answer the following!

After all the stories have been submitted, we will select a couple to share live at service and feature the rest on Insta for the week post-camp/leading up to grad cluster:) (Hence, the length limit)🏹🏹🏹

[10/6/19, 11:56:28 AM] Megan ARROW: HELLU We are officially 1 WEEK AWAY from camp wuhuuu 🥳🥳 Regarding finale night, a huge thank you to the costume and item team who have prepped so much for it, as well as the people who have come down to help prep the costumes!! 🤩 We’re changing it up abit this year, we’re not going to have one character per CG, so do look at the following pictures to see which character you would be during finale night!! 😝 *Colour code is inside the pics as well*

If you cannot find your name inside, that would be becus Megs (frm CJ) has texted you regarding your role during the performance, she’ll let you know what you’ll need to wear soon!! 🙂

Heres a summary:
1.  StarLord: Grey tee
2. Drax: Army/Pale Green tee (Pls try not to wear a bright green cus it would look too similar to Gamora)
3. Gamora: Bright green tee
4. Rocket: Orange tee

Hope yall are as excited as I am for finale night ☺☺
[10/6/19, 11:56:42 AM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys yall can send the following to your SA Combined camp chat!!

1. Our reporting time is 745am on Monday at Harbourfront Cruise Centre, BUT 745am reporting time means we should be boarding the bus by that time so we should be meeting at *720am*, exact timing we'll let yall know again closer to the date!!
2. Our reporting colour on Monday is *WHITE*!!
3. The whole CJ CG will be together on Bus 2!!
4. For coming back after camp, *DO NOT* wear the camp tee on the last day, lets wear it together at camp on another one of the days!!
5. If your parents are asking you what time you would be back on Friday, the estimated timing for us would be 4-4.30pm but ofc it depends on the traffic that day
6. For our camp schedule, please refer to the pic!!
‎[10/6/19, 12:31:12 PM] Megan ARROW: ‎image omitted

[10/6/19, 2:43:00 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: oooo okay!! sorry just checking in case i missed anything GAHAHA bc for dare camp they said that too at the briefing but afterwards there was a correction that they cannot wear the shirt at all bc of the explicit designs :,)
[10/6/19, 3:09:21 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: ^ yup! Military T-shirts may be a bit sensitive.. don’t want to risk their safety
[10/6/19, 3:10:47 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Same as above! They mentioned during camper’s briefing after arrow that the camp T-shirt can be worn on any of the days from Day 2-4, but just wear a jacket over it while walking through the mall area :)
[10/6/19, 3:10:57 PM] Megan ARROW: Oki shall we just not wear it then
[10/6/19, 6:22:59 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys like we were discussing the other day i need nominations for planning team and panel for our grad cluster so just put the names down below oki!

[12/6/19, 10:59:03 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: likely their journey in arrow, what the Lord has done for them in their arrow years, along that vein :)
[12/6/19, 10:59:35 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: we'll have more flexibility of time in cluster as compared to service.. and also the youths personally know them so it would have a bigger impact?
[12/6/19, 10:59:48 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: and i guess smaller crowd can encourage them to share more real-ly
[12/6/19, 10:59:52 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: ooo okiE
[12/6/19, 11:00:03 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: as compared to stage which might be a bit scary

[13/6/19, 12:25:48 AM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: If you have a youth you want to nominate, can put their name down first with a tbc while you ask them. Ps if this wasn’t clear. (Maybe moving forward we can decide whether future lists are for discussion or means confirmed)

If there are over-supply of youths who are able to serve, @6597300351 and I can decide who are in the final list:) 

I told KJ to put first since he alr had a youth in mind. Don’t need to wait for other leaders first cuz we need to get this list confirmed soon:)

[19/6/19, 9:25:07 AM] Rox SOUTH: *JC Leaders Huddle *
* You are doing better than you think 
* Ride on what the Lord is doing - this generation is going to hunger for the things of God
* 2 Activities to do with CG over the next few days
- Decide what is their spiritual habit they want to adopt
- Teach them to prophesy from the word. Gather them to pair up - ask the Lord for a verse; which book should I open up - word for their friends. What we do is that we give them and cultivate a taste for the things of the Lord (Taste and see that the Lord is good!) the youths will walk out seeing what it’s like to experience the Lord.
‎[19/6/19, 9:28:39 AM] Rox SOUTH: ‎image omitted
[19/6/19, 9:28:57 AM] Rox SOUTH: Thanks guys for being so on time and responsive! Here’s the mini-CGM, u can build each activity into a different meal time/cg sesh:) 

*How do you want to involve the word (God) in your daily life?*

“My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. *(Listen to the Word)*

Do not let them depart from your eyes;  *(Read the Word)*

Keep them in the midst of your heart; 
*(Meditate on the Word)*

For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭4:20-23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

*Activity 1:*
Form a spiritual habit of the word in your daily life

Before/After I (current habit), I will (spiritual habit) 

Eg. Before I brush my teeth, I will read Psalms 23 over myself.

*Activity 2*
 Pray in the spirit and ask the Lord for a book name, verse number or word. Then read the word and see how it resonates to you

*Activity 3*
Pair up with a friend, go into the word and trust the Lord to lead you to a word for your friend and share with them.

[20/6/19, 7:03:21 PM] Rox SOUTH: South Testimonies

Zenden J2 SAC 
* Camp was like a roller coaster. Reached subway, was disappointed before Camp started because he heard bad news about his grand dad
* Day 1 and Day 2 nothing spoke to him so he was angry and disappointed
* Told his leader Kai Jie 
* Was reminded how impt community was 
* Talked to Sherrie in the afternoon - you should have an open heart
* Men’s service about an open heart
* Alicia’s prayer - you think you know the Lord but there’s so much more He has for you and He is always with you. And circumstances doesn’t define me.

Felicia, SA 
* camp felt very mundane and dull - forced to be in His presence 
* This year, He met me through using me to speak to others 
* Prayed for others, and used to always hate it because it felt forced, and found out they were accurate 

Zoe, SA A
* first camp in church 
* Few months - felt like she lost herself, very dry, couldn’t find God 
* Didn’t like herself for not feeling excited 
* Prayed for strangers, such as a guy next to him, Lord gave her courage. 
* “god you are so good, you used me to help others” 

Erissa SA A 
* this season felt like a plateau to her - what can you show me that you have not shown me before 
* Vision for camp - warm and cozy / hugs and warm vibes 
* Didn’t know she was still affected by what happened in her family. 
* Heard the Lord calling her the baptism name Area- because you are not defined by your earthly Father. 
* Random girl prayed for her - that she is being hugged by God 
* Another camp expectation - struggling to worship - distracted by singing well. Learned that worship is really her and the Lord - in spirit and truth. Allowed her to enjoy worship for the first time in her life. 

Edward SA A 
* got distracted in school - hit an all time Low. 
* Did okay last year for exams cos he worked hard 
* But this year, had really bad grades, lowest in all his school life
* Tore his ACL and missed one week of school and missed the papers he had the most confidence in 
* Scored so Low, parents were called in to talk to VP , felt like it was a big humiliation 
* Felt like he was not chosen to be a Christian, doesn’t feel in touch with the Lord like his Friend Felicia 
* Ryan was a big part of his life last year, and missed him a lot. 
* Parents don’t know much of his life, doesn’t feel loved at home in the way he wants it to be 
* Didn’t tell his friends, kept everything inside, felt low.
* Rachel appealed for him for camp. Didn’t think he could go cos his parents would never pay for me. 
* Rachel passed him the money to go to camp 
* Believed that God gave up for him 
* First day - intimacy with God, touched him a bit, teared a little, didn’t wanna cry
* Second day - Lucas prayed for him - you are here for a reason cos God wants you - cried a lot. Felt embarrassed for crying 
* Calista prayed for him. Only knew each other for Two days. “Let down these walls of your emotions and you will be stronger” 
* Ryan found him and hugged him and talked to him at 1am and talked to him and reminded him that “he mattered” 

Calista SA A
* used to go to date very regularly 
* Feb to Mar was a very rough period for her - tough to accept her emotions
* Felt like no one knew her - how to be vulnerable? If she wasn’t positive or happy, didn’t want to give the impression of mental instability.
* Bad things happened to her family before camp 
* Entered camp with a huge burden and pain in her heart, first time she really desired for  breakthrough 
* Didn’t feel she would be comfortable telling people in cg her problems  
* Told Berwin about her situation, the words spoken were very accurate
* Pastor called for the fathering call; went to Debs - she was already crying. The words were comforting and accurate. 
* Night; another ministering session - Rachel prayed her - the word was more than 120% accurate in her life. Broke down again.
* Felt very thankful for the community here amidst all the doubts 
* Went to the Family one - open to problems and feelings despite being strangers - that’s when the Lord can come in to help him 
* Hurt her that people were going through so much but it was concealed. All the more when you turn to God, your burdens will be lifted up. If you don’t anticipate, how would you receive your portion? 

Shang CJ B 
* 1 month before camp- didn’t tell them he was going to church even though he’s been coming for 3 years
* Very close to his parents ever since getting into Arrow
* Parents are staunch buddhists
* Afraid of risking the relationship with his years of half truths. 
* Dad had a bad fall 
* Was difficult to see him aching had to buy food for his families over the three days and he pushed back telling them 
* Started blaming himself for his dad’s fault 
* Couldn’t do it, couldn’t tell his parents that he was at camp 
* Day 3 - Tierney asked him what’s his dream? His dream was to go with His parents at Star and eat at Awfully Chocolate. Felt like it was an impossible dream to him.
* Day 3 Worship - sang Glorious Ruins and cried a lot. Ps Dans exhortation about empty rooms really spoke to him and was something that he journaled before coming to camp. 
* 
Tim, CJ B 
* 4 months since he entered a high stress job
* Was very frustrated because he felt like he lost touch with God
* Wanted to come to camp as he took it as a holiday for his job 
* Came to camp with a bit of tension with Berwin because 
* At worship, was able to cry during worship his heart felt so  painful 
* Appreciated his leaders a lot more - Berwin and Tierney. Was very happy for Berwin to wipe his feet. Wiped his feet - cried even more, Berwin hugged him and cried even more so. 
* Very thankful for Tierney as he connects with him as a Friend. Grateful to cry together. 
* Thankful for Berwin who is always there for him.

And it all sounds like HOO

And it all sounds likeee? HOOoooooo

(Everyone joins in)

Criss cross legs shoulder snap

Can can can can you feel it?

JC is rising up

Reaching the lost and weary

Loving on broken hearts

(STOMP)

One name above all others 

One name that we exalt

Of one name we're singing praises

Jesus our living God

Jesus our living God

JESUS OUR LIVING GOD

[25/6/19, 12:05:09 PM] Rox SOUTH: Morning leaders!! We’d had such an awesome time at camp~ 

Pastor mentioned at the end of camp that we are a generation powered by the One. Not only does God have a dream, and not only are we His dream, but *His dreams continue to live on through us*! Over the next *22 days*, riding on camp, we’ll be releasing a series of *Mission IMpossible* tasks for the youths to continue to walk out what God has worked in them during camp! 
🌏🌍🌎

These could include live loved (reading the word, fellowshipping with the Lord) kind of activities or live loving (on others) moments. 👨🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀

Look out for the mission briefs sent on *Instagram daily* and encourage your youths to take them on together (don’t exclude yourself!!) — the way they competed for CSI 😜 believing that the Lord will do the seemingly impossible even as we step out in baby steps of faith everyday~ 

Also, y’all shall have a super favoured back to work/school/life start to the week today!! ☃
[25/6/19, 12:05:50 PM] Rox SOUTH: The ❤ behind the missions thing ^ truly we live life loved, and we lived life loving 😊💪🌈 declaring it shall bless you and the people too!!

HELLO FRIENDS  view of the nation-wide move to stop the unnecessary collection and use of NRIC details from September 2019, our church will be doing a church-wide exercise in the upcoming months to comply with the move. 🙃

Here's an overview of the timeline😊😊 
_(NOTE: 2 items requiring your action)_ : -

*B Y  2 8  J U N* [PLS ACTION☝🏻] - ensure all leaders and servers are properly tagged on NOAH 
_*(aka even your CG ambassadors, etc, are all properly tagged as they will receive an email on next point)*_

*1  J U L Y* - a memo will be emailed to all leaders and servers requesting that we update our NOAH profile. This is because we'll be using our mobile numbers for log-in instead.

*1 8  J U L Y* - a memo will be sent to the rest of the congregation regarding the above

*A U G U S T* - role out of new NOAH login

*B Y  1 6  A U G U S T* [FYNA ✌🏻] - securely remove (delete/shred) all datasets/documents/whatsapp text/forms/emails, etc. bearing NRIC

=======
_ICYMI..._
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/organisations-collecting-nric-details-from-september-2019-10670148
=======

Thank u so much for working w us to comply w the laws of the land!!! 🙆🏻‍♀
[26/6/19, 7:14:59 PM] Rox SOUTH: Why don't recruits go to Jesus for a haircut? Because once sHaved by Christ, you're forever sHaved.... 😭

Declaring that the Lord makes you the Head and not the tail, Above and not beneath. Tonight, you shall go to sleep well-rested knowing that you are well-able to take the land! For the horse is prepared for battle, but it is the Lord who gives the victory!!!🌈🌲⛈ No matter the feelings of lack, inadequacy or strife, Southies shall rest in the knowledge that the Lord is good and He reigns over all things. He shall supernaturally bring to mind all the answers, and His wisdom and favour shall set all your scripts apart. Your heavenly Abba is in control, and He is the hope that *never* disappoints! 🌞 His peace is unshakeable!!!

_Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong._
2 Corinthians 12:9‭-‬10

🌟🥇 The battle is the Lord's!!🌟🥇 Take heart and sleep early tonight ❤ The Lord is with you!!

[1/7/19, 10:09:33 PM] Megan ARROW: Thanks yall!!!
[1/7/19, 10:17:16 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys, this is regarding the tagging/untagging of freshies on NOAH. I've done up a document with instructions, its in the Admin folder in our South folder, labelled 'Splitting of CG Freshies'. Do follow the instructions in that document, I think should give a good explanation and guidance. 🙂

Impt notes
1. For the leaders of A CGs (i.e. CJ A and SA A), please do not untag the freshies until the other CGs (B and C) have tagged their freshies, this is just in case there is any issue with the tagging, at least the freshie is still tagged to the A CG and we can refer back to the freshie’s details to do the tagging. For the B and C CGs, just let the leader of the A CG know when you’re done with the tagging, then the leader of the A CG can proceed with the untagging!
2. The start/end date should be *1 July 2019*!!

Anything yall unsure about can text me! 🙂 Will check in with yall again at the end of this week to see how the progress is!!

Keep them in the midst of your heart; 
*(Meditate on the Word)*

For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭4:20-23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

*Activity 1:*
Form a spiritual habit of the word in your daily life

Before/After I (current habit), I will (spiritual habit) 

Eg. Before I brush my teeth, I will read Psalms 23 over myself.

*Activity 2*
 Pray in the spirit and ask the Lord for a book name, verse number or word. Then read the word and see how it resonates to you

*Activity 3*
Pair up with a friend, go into the word and trust the Lord to lead you to a word for your friend and share with them.
[6/7/19, 9:48:42 AM] Rox SOUTH: This was from camp :)
[6/7/19, 9:55:12 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: Thanks:)
[6/7/19, 9:56:51 AM] Rox SOUTH: ☀ Good morning Shepherds ☀

Declaring with you that CG shall be a time of yet not us but God who lives in us. That the time and activity shall be so spirit led and such refreshment poured forth over His people in community! Declaring that the CGs shall taste and see that the Lord is good!!! The CG is fun, well-rested and graced ✨💕 whatever words that needs to be spoken in love shall be spoken and will not fall to the ground! IJN AMEN!

Eccl 3:11
He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also *set eternity* in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.

He is moving :)) 

Encourage you all too;
• that now is the time to rally your core to armourbear your hearts / even if you don’t feel like you have a core - the Lord is building them up! Let’s be intentional with the flock too.
• ride the camp momentum. It may seem like a natural dip after exams but we are a strong and spiritual generation; not a weak and natural
[6/7/19, 9:58:25 AM] Rox SOUTH: • practical reminders are like the Arrow min 22/22 on Instagram hehe ❤

[13/7/19, 1:39:51 PM] Rox SOUTH: What’s your ETA!
[13/7/19, 2:44:06 PM] Loocurse ARROW: My impossible dream for the CG

Kaijie - serving with my girlfriend in ministry (whether staying here/zao), CG can come in and chip in about anything, cluster nothing

Lucas - Bringing more souls to Christ, didn't really have a heart for the people of the world previously, admin process of bringing them to church was tedious to him but now he knows that it's just about them meeting God. For his CG to grow spiritually, for them to know their calling and to walk it out (impossible to him cus they're so young). For the cluster to be onz about
 doing church tgt

Rach - for CG, catch the heart of serving, not to be caught up in the hype. For myself, to be less afraid of my own expectation, to get over the fear of men. For cluster, rawness - unafraid & unashamed to worship in abandonment.

Vans - super crazy outside of church that's unconventional but will reach many people, but bound by ethics. Not just serving inside church but outside church too. For CG, they rlly know Jesus for themselves. For cluster, less passive about cluster stuff, know each other and b strong tgt as South!!

Tierney - hear the Lords voice and go with it. For CG, see all the irregulars respond and see the reg youths be blessed to be a blessing. For cluster, unity.

Megan - finding a job I rlly love with gr8 company culture. for CG, grow a lot more and have their identity in Christ and be grounded in the Word. For certain youths, to step up. For cluster, unity. Stepping up to serve in cluster by catching the heart of serving.

Berwin - for CG, be the most loving caregroup in Arrow. Cluster, all in for the Lord and out does each other in love. A sphere of influence with no boundaries. For myself, see the dream that God has placed come to pass in my life. Counter culture
[13/7/19, 2:58:45 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Rox - for myself, live freely from the weight of fear from new career, job, relationships. To believe that God can still be good even when circumstances are not.
For South sheppies - no one gets left behind!!! 🙆🏼‍♂ For each of us to see that we are appointed and anointed
For cluster - live loved (in community) and live loving (every youth a server, leader)
[13/7/19, 4:38:08 PM] Sherrie The Shepherd 🐑: Hey Lucas and Vans, can y’all help to fill front seats later? :)

just wanna say that you guys are really the MVPs ☺😢 thank you for running with all the plan changes, longer wait times and the gaps in communication :’)) really SUPER appreciate you all and your great hearts of love, to spend time with the youths and pour out onto them and to lead the way so boldly in love 😊✨✊ 

✨I’m certain that the youths were inspired by your fearlessness in love (like how Berwin and Rach Lee really went all out to find the Arrow aged youths etc ;) and the many more precious encounters you shared) ☺❤

Please have a blessed rest tonight 💕🌻 It is an exciting week ahead of us ✊🎆 but know that the Lord is in the midst of us and we are a leadership that is not moved by demands but moved by the Spirit 🙌 With Him, we are well able to take the land! 👣

[22/7/19, 10:11:53 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hi leaders 🤠

Our Homecoming Service is less than a week away and we have a few suggestions & reminders! 

🗣- Have a conversation with your youths about the heart (why we are doing this!! Create a group chat with your core/regular youths if that helps!)

💻- Look at Noah to identify the irregulars and assign them to your regular youths to text them (sneak attac!) 

💌- Delegate youths to write letters (divide and conquer)

👦🏻👧🏻 - friends are welcome too even if they’re not irregulars! So feel free to invite friends~ 

Thank you for your spirit of excellence, we believe this is the start of a revival! ✨
[22/7/19, 10:12:01 PM] Berwin ARROW: @6590174449 pls read HAHA
[22/7/19, 10:13:26 PM] Berwin ARROW: Encourage all of us to rly create a group chat!! With your regular/core youths. So y’all can:

- divide and conquer irregular youths to text/invite for svc

- delegate letters

[25/7/19, 8:25:19 PM] Vanessa: Eh sorry I support late I was sleeping HAHHA yay!! Heheh thank ber 🙆🏻‍♀️
[25/7/19, 8:56:49 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hey guys!! I wanna share a testimony!! 🙂🙂 Gna be a bit long...

So rewind back to NS, I had quite a scarring experience in my office job because the bosses were super hard and the politics was mad bad. Everyone was backstabbing and trashing each other. And I rlly didn't perform well there :( I always messed up easy stuff and I felt damn dumb. I went thru trusting the Lord that it'll be better but it never did and I wasn't rlly well liked by the department (rightfully so).

So I thought i could just leave it all behind in NS but it kept haunting me. Everytime I messed up something in school, I always feared that I'll be a lousy worker, someone who can't follow my boss instructions and gna be useless to my company. And I think it even spilled over to ministry sometimes.

So then this summer came and I embarked on this internship with lots of fears, but also with this rlly great verse.

But diligence is man’s precious possession.
Proverbs 12:27b

Ya so I rlly went in with the idea of giving my best at every small thing I do. If I make a genuine mistake, it's okay, but I just didn't wanna make any mistakes that I could avoid by checking it twice or whatever.

And PTLLL today my career coaches from school came down and he spoke of me (my colleagues were eavesdropping) super well. He said I was a "bright kid" LOL and when the career coach came to me, she said "wow with such appraisal from your boss I believe you're gonna go far" and for my strengths and areas to improve in, my boss gave 7 strengths and 1 area to improve in LOL.

Ya I think it's smt that would have been impossible if you told me would happen before this internship, but I'm so glad to see the hand of the Lord in this area of my life 🙆🏼‍♂🙆🏼‍♂

TLDR: Thought I would suck at my job, His word in my life reaped a harvest and my boss loves me now (he's tryna convert me to be a public servant rn actually)
[25/7/19, 10:01:13 PM] Vanessa: Whew!!!! Amen amen! That’s good Loo 🌈🥳

Declaring that every spirit of inertia and fatigue and unbelief shall cease in the move of His love that overwhelms our hearts in every which way - for both the leadership and South. That South is marked by an uncommon desire to linger in His presence and be watered by the Word, and this is the spirit that even the most naturally distant CG member shall catch so supernaturally!! That His rest guards every core youth hearts today - that they shall be bold to speak, to love, and to see their realities in the CG align to His word. In Jesus name amen 💓🌟😎

[28/7/19, 5:45:15 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: *Serve Cluster on 21 July*

*Good*
- Berwin: great
    • met a first-timer youth
- The youths and servers really enjoyed it on both sides
- Having youths at the service venues brought a lot of joy and vibrancy to the main church

*Feedback*
- Moving forward suggestion: to have a youth connection point that focuses on reaching out to the youths at main, perhaps a once a month thing and not just only on special events
- Emphasise on how love attack is not just giving gifts, but the heart that you carry to love (and loving can = praying, talking etc.) 
- Have a better idea of the space that we can move around in
    • E.g, level 7 there were two connect points but we only went to one
- Operationally: would have been better to have a clearer timeline, if not things are very on the fly = a little messy; let’s also honour the youths’ time!!
[28/7/19, 5:45:44 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: sorry these are the notes from SLM about serve cluster!!
[28/7/19, 5:54:44 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: also, just wanted to share smthg rlly cool about Homecoming service :,) 

so the plan that i rolled out with my cg was for the regulars to reach out to the irregulars in their batch bc i wanted them to see that SAA is not just mine; it’s theirs and i want the regulars to catch the heart of owning this space and bringing their friends to see Jesus themselves :,,))) 

the crazy thing is within the same day that i shared with them the idea (on tues afternoon!), they were super onz and they reached out to 3/4 the irregs. by thursday night, all the irregs had been invited for the service and thEY CAME!! aside from one youth who’s sick, one nsf on duty overseas and another nsf enjoying his day leave, my cg had full attendance yesterday 😭

i used to joke that my cg is my core but i see that i have subconsciously spoken it into existence Jesus i repent HAHHAHHA but it’s really so crazy wahhh... and even tho im still trusting God for the real full CG attendance i think it’s q crazy that this could even happened and i hope it encourages anyone else here with irregulars still not coming that thEY SHALL COME in Jesus name amEN :,,,))
[28/7/19, 6:12:33 PM] Berwin ARROW: Wow 😭
[28/7/19, 6:16:04 PM] Vanessa: AMEN LA RACH 😭 that’s so good! And ya!!!!! Really Amen amen 🌈🌈🌈

[29/7/19, 10:49:18 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Btw! What's the CGM for this week? Is it serving?
[29/7/19, 10:56:48 PM] Rox SOUTH: You can choose any CGM from the pool, depending on what you feel is the best direction for your CG :) but generally, there are some directions that Arrow is going in! :)) If you haven't planned CG yet, can think about how to align too!! :) it's always good to run with the heart of the ministry hehe :)🔥💒🔥

👉Generally, the quarter Arrow is focusing on is about growing the youth's *Word Life*
 👉 & since, Arrow Ministry is studying David for the next month, we are encouraged to study the *life of David* - maybe his early life (1 Sam 16) ☺💕 bc JC kids love pre-revision teasers HAHHA but it’s up to you!!
[30/7/19, 12:22:46 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Okay thanks Rox!!
[30/7/19, 1:39:17 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hello Beloved Shepherds! 😁 The cluster worship team is currently looking at doing a recruitment, so we need your help to send us a list of youths in your CG who can either sing or play the piano/guitar/cajon (percussion). 🎤🎹🎸🥁🎼

This list should include all youths who are currently serving in your CG's worship team. 

In the list, please indicate their name, instrument and level of experience so that we get a better understanding of the worship manpower that our cluster is looking at! 

To describe their level of experience, you may use one of the below: 
1⃣ EE - extremely experienced 
• As a leader, you feel that he/she is currently ready to put up for cluster
2⃣ SE - slightly experienced 
• For now the youth is not ready yet, but you have the intention for him/her to be put up for cluster in the near future
3⃣ NE - not experienced 
• He/she is serving for CG, but you do not have the intention to put he/she up for cluster anytime soon

Do note that if you were to put EE, your youth does not have to be super zai or experienced! What we're looking out for is youths who have a heart for worship, and youths who you see that there is an anointing that flows when they worship ✨

Honestly, whoever the Lord impresses upon your heart to add to the list, even if they've never served for CG much (or at all), please add them to the list as well!! Just need to highlight it to us ☺ 

Do send me this list by ________. 

Thank you! 🐸

👉This Sat was the *highest South Svc attendance* of the year (after Good Friday Evangelistic), and a >10 increase from May!! :")) & the *highest numbers of IRs* returning to sheepfold over the year 🙂 this, even after the grads graduated! 
👉 Praise the Lord!! hehe  and just wanna stand in faith together that there is MORE breakthroughs ahead!! :"") 
👉 & South actually saw numbers *close to our faith goals* with full-houses for the regulars in some CGs!! 
👉Paul planted, Apollos watered, and it is God who gives the increase!!! 
👉Trust the Lord that He is building your core and your CGs ❤ let's lean in to Lord moreso, and hear Him :") 

2⃣Second, send in your *CGMs* by _tonight_ , _latest tmr morning_ so that I have time to take a look at it~ 
👉Feel free to choose a CGM from the pool! There is no direct specification, but no.7 is about serving. 🙂
👉Also, you can think about aligning to the ministry direction of (1) Word Life and studying (2) David's life - esp his early years :") 

3⃣Third, Zone X!! 🙂 - 6/7 Sep 2019 

👉Arrow is the Saturday (7 Sep) one 🙂 Encourage your youths to purchase your tix soon, go together, and invite a friend :') there's cool merch avail!
👉 bit.ly/zonex2019-students
👉You can encourage your youths to serve too on 6 sep!! Do note that if they are serving, they won't have a seat indoors. 
👉Connectors is by *Your* nomination! It's totally cool if they've sign up for other roles, as the Arrow team will look through the nominated names and then select and send them an invite link 🙂  
👉If there are more-than-abundant connector noms, the youths will be re-chanelled and encouraged to serve in the Welcome team 🙂 
👉 Let me know if you want to serve on 6 Sep as a Connector! 🙂 I'll nominate y'all~ 🙂

4⃣Fourth, Thanks for being so quick to follow up with the NS Men, Worship and Arrow Amigo stuff! Really really appreciate you all ❤ 

5⃣🌟🌟🌟Fifth, let's keep one another in prayer and guard one another's spiritual backs this week!! (silently bumps the prayer roster) ❤ 

Love y'all! 🏆🐏🏆 true shepherd-sheep champs!!!

[31/7/19, 3:08:47 PM] Rox SOUTH: ======================

⚡ *BOLD* to reach out
🤩 *ENTHUSIASTIC*

This team of special forces will play a key role in positively affecting the atmosphere at ZONE X, creating a welcoming experience for everyone, ESP. our invited friendsss!! 🥳 If you know of anyone who *_(1)fits the bill_* and are _*(2)willing*_ and *_(3)available_*, please nominate them here *BY 3 AUG (SAT)*: bit.ly/zonex2019-connectors

(actually I realised I gave wrong info to Megan and Rach ;~; sorry megs and rach but shouldn't affect you or your youths haha)

the steps for nomination are (1) CGLs/PS will nominate your youth through the form - so fill the google form for them, (2) Arrow team will look through the list of nominees, and (3) if selected, the Arrow team will send a specific link for the youth to sign up.

So the current form is actually for the pastoral peeps to nominate :))

[5/8/19, 10:57:50 AM] Rox SOUTH: Also since today is Monday!! Here’s my special Mission LOL 

Declaring over the South Leadership, that we shall taste and see John 4:14 in our lives!! His spirit-refreshing, thirst-quenching, all-satisfying source of Life is what marks our days. That we shall be so occupied by His presence, enjoying the days of Heaven on Earth. That when emotions and thought tries to shake us - what remains is His unshakeable truth. This week, we shall grow in grace 🥰 and there shall be such a steadfast desire to linger in His presence above all clutter. There shall be daily reminders that we are His delight, from the scent of dew to the favour of a colleague to the smile of a stranger. He has us right where we need to be :) In Jesus name amen 💕✨🇸🇬

_John 4:14 New International Version (NIV) but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life._

[25/8/19, 7:31:14 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hi guys!!! We are about 2 weeks to ~ *ZONEX* 7th sep, sat 530pm!! 

Just wanted to encourage y’all to come together as a CG and pray for the people you want to invite and set a faith goal 🥰 

Have sent you all a ticket to get started going forth in bold faith but y’all can ask the Lord if the cg wants to come together to be a blessing too ✨🥰

At the risk of sounding like an Insurance Agent, we’ll insurance for eternity HAHHAHA, let’s encourage all of us to see beyond the monetary investment as an investment in souls 🥰🌈

Even that feeling where closer to the date, we get more desperate (since the $$’s been spent HAHAHA)??? just imagine, the Lord’s far more desperate to meet His beloved sheep who are out there in this world 💗💗

We are blessed to be a blessing 🌧❤ let’s believe for His extravagant goodness to be seen in the land of the living for South and for Arrow!! 

🔥 let’s keep praying in the spirit hehe

[26/8/19, 1:14:02 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Hey guys what time does zone X end? 730-8?
[26/8/19, 8:08:47 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I think so eh
[26/8/19, 8:08:56 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I also tried search the faq
[26/8/19, 8:09:22 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Okay, i shall just assume its at that time~
[26/8/19, 8:52:21 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Guys just asking, are yall planning to have dinner with your youths after zone x?
[26/8/19, 8:52:44 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Still contemplating cause i hve fam dinner
[26/8/19, 8:52:47 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I was thinking of not having dinner as a CG eh, because I want my youths to go talk to their friends about how the svc went
[26/8/19, 8:53:00 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Why not have a dinner with them and heir friends?
[26/8/19, 8:53:05 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Their*
[26/8/19, 8:53:16 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Err because a lot of new people then hard to facilitate conversation
[26/8/19, 8:54:02 PM] Loocurse ARROW: And like I'd rather they have the opportunity to have a good conversation with the friend that brought them about what they like about svc, who's Jesus etc etc
[26/8/19, 8:54:09 PM] Loocurse ARROW: @6592323502 what dyou think?
[26/8/19, 8:54:36 PM] Loocurse ARROW: And I'm also thinking logistically, it's v hard to bring like 20 people out for dinner at the star
[26/8/19, 9:02:37 PM] Rox SOUTH: Ya this!! I think u don’t have to be the one facilitating the conversation :) u can break them out into groups! Cos the idea is also that for those who couldn’t bring friends, they too can help engage and form friendships amongst the new peeps. The heart behind the post zone x dinner (there’s an after party too!) is so it’s not a they just interact w the friend they brought but also feel connected to sth larger / no one gets left behind. Like knowing more than one familiar face :) and it gives u the opportunity to look out for that one. U can convey this heart to your regular youths so they can be intentional about getting to know the new peeps too :)

I think there’s some free seating options like the sheltered area near the big steps.
[26/8/19, 9:06:07 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hmm will it be v full tho
[26/8/19, 9:08:36 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Because I see it becoming very messy crowded and then a bunch of awkward "hi Im... What class are you in...."
[26/8/19, 9:09:07 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I'd rather equip my youths bringing friends with questions they can ask them
[26/8/19, 9:09:28 PM] Loocurse ARROW: And having it decentralised will help give them better environments to have these convos
[26/8/19, 9:10:37 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Confirm crowded, unless everyone thinks it is crowded and dont go haha
[26/8/19, 9:10:54 PM] Loocurse ARROW: But I think my overall heart is that I want the focus for zone x to be on service experience and meeting Jesus, and then if they like the service etc, they can come back to arrow svc where my emphasis for them is for community
[26/8/19, 9:12:08 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: You can equip your youths now haha, and still be around to see how they interact with the nbncs and you can give them feedback:)
[26/8/19, 9:12:31 PM] Loocurse ARROW: But I just concern about the environment
[26/8/19, 9:12:41 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: True luh, not so ideal
[26/8/19, 9:12:54 PM] Loocurse ARROW: After come like that :(
[26/8/19, 9:13:59 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I know what you mean by awkward cg 😢 i have been through that too
[26/8/19, 9:14:44 PM] Loocurse ARROW: No not rlly about awkward CG, it's just I prefer the NBNCs to be with the friends who brought them
[26/8/19, 9:14:55 PM] Loocurse ARROW: The only issue is foresee is if they bring friends from multiple sources
[26/8/19, 9:15:57 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Well, i come from the perspective of the new comer. Wonder what they will expect. Would they see like oh after cg meet the amazing cgl who raised their friends or something
[26/8/19, 9:16:20 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Haha amen
[26/8/19, 9:17:01 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahaha tho I don't think any newcomer would wna meet the CGL who raised their friend tho
[26/8/19, 9:17:07 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: 🤣🤣
[26/8/19, 9:17:18 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okay bc whenever I bring friends, I always bring them out after to talk about how their experiences were
[26/8/19, 9:17:31 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: You are a very fun guy to be with i am sure they wont mine 😬
[26/8/19, 9:17:32 PM] Loocurse ARROW: It's a good opporunity to have that convo
[26/8/19, 9:17:48 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahaha but Idw them to just have fun yknow
[26/8/19, 9:18:02 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I want them to talk about why they accept christ/didn't
[26/8/19, 9:18:08 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Or how they felt about the svc
[26/8/19, 9:18:23 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Yea i agree, didnt mean jt that way,but i think as the leader you have the ability to steer the convo
[26/8/19, 9:19:03 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: I see where you are coming from also haha
[26/8/19, 9:19:36 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahaa I just thinking from the perspective of me bringing my friends, what would I want
[26/8/19, 9:19:48 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Yea haha i know whatchu mean~
[26/8/19, 9:21:13 PM] Loocurse ARROW: @6592323502 TL;DR I prefer to have my youths have meaningful conversations about zone x with friends, and making the CG gather tgt as one would make it more difficult.
[26/8/19, 10:29:20 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hmmmm, I see where you are coming from, get ya on that! ☺ I am also for the idea of decentralised / smaller break out groups so that it is easier to talk 😊 

but why can’t your youths have meaningful conversations about the zone x experience in the same area? :) cos I’m also thinking it may be better if u can access them easier- u never know how the spirit will lead u to the group that He wants you to join! And it also allows everyone, even those who didn’t bring a friend, to be involved :) building community and talking about their zone x experience doesn’t have to happen on separate days. 

it can be more intentional in that way too - cos practically, it provides a different environment w an intentional group consisting of the Nbnc, person who invited them, and some cg people who want to be the nbnc friends and are leaning in to hear about their lives. This helps to establish the way for when they return - cos it’s much easier to come back when they have a widened circle + know more faces than the one that invited them. :) and it’s not so heavy for the person who invites the nbncs to anchor the conversation- cos they can organically talk about other things.

and these cg friends that they have made can also look out for them in school! 

Also, sometimes - when you are already friends before, you don’t rlly push for a different/ more intentional kind of interaction. So the new environment of different mixes of friends can help :)
[26/8/19, 10:29:56 PM] Rox SOUTH: Anw I hope I make sense I’m a bit sleepy cos I just finished a night seminar LOL. Mmm any questions, can call me? Goes out to anyone of y’all here too 🙆🏻☺
[26/8/19, 10:39:58 PM] Loocurse ARROW: HAHAH THANKS Rox for typing that all out 🙆🏼‍♂
[26/8/19, 10:46:12 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Nawh Im concerned about the space and the size of the group
[26/8/19, 10:47:46 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Bc the steps are defo out, and Idw the case of scrambling to find a place while we have a lot of NBNCs in the cg
[26/8/19, 10:52:50 PM] Rox SOUTH: This is for your cg or all of SA? Last year I brought a group of >25 to the outside rock kidz there, it was quite conducive! But u can consider other places too? :) like near the BV Macs also got places to sit around etc! Or Rochester Mall also has “rooftop” spaces to sit etc 

If you all lived in the East (which you all don’t), I would recommend stadium haha.
[26/8/19, 10:53:47 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hmm okie I'll scout the area for good places then!
[26/8/19, 10:53:51 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Haha i think for zone x we have the whole zone min around there probably looking for place to sit, hence Lu’s concern
[26/8/19, 10:53:51 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Thanks Rox!

[28/8/19, 10:30:22 PM] Rox SOUTH: And let’s keep meditating on what Ps Daniel shared about walking onwards into His promise land of goodness and favour :) that just as the Fathers heart is for the one, He is opening our eyes and making our spirits alert and alive to see as He sees and move as He moves and love as He loves 🥰 WE are the church on the move and in our own spheres of influence, He is showing our hearts visions of the promise land 🥰 and they too shall surely come to past because our God is a promise keeper :)) let’s  trust the Lord together for the faces and lives He has put on our hearts even as we trust for the CGs too :”) 

Rlly loved the reminder today 😢 my soul needed that sight of His will be done on Earth!!! and more than the “work”, our hearts shall encounter again and again, a Jesus who refreshes and restores, who holds our lives together 🙆🏻

[6/9/19, 9:13:30 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys, the video would show you a rough layout of how the place is going to be like tomorrow!! This is based on today’s Zone X event and is subjected to changes but should be more or less the same!

Layout points to note:
1. When you come up you can proceed into Star Gallery to register! 
2. After you register, proceed behind the registration counter to collect your goodie bags!
3. Behind that, theres light displays that you can take photos with and theres also the coffee station there!
4. After you’re done, you can head out of Star Gallery to chill at the board area or at the steps, we can decide on the exact location tomorrow based on the crowd!

*For those bringing friends*
Would highly recommend you registering your friends all at one go and collecting the bands + goodie bags on their behalf, dont need so many people to go into the registration area cus it can get quite messy :”)
[6/9/19, 9:13:41 PM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys yall can use this to send to your youths if u want :)
[6/9/19, 9:14:00 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: wahhhh thanks megan!!!

[7/9/19, 2:18:50 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hello guys!! *today is the day!! wuhuuuu*  :"))
thank you guys who have served / are serving later - the Lord shall restore to you strength and double the portion!! 

declaring over every CG today, that all who walked through the doors shall feel so ministered too, and so welcomed, knowing that this is where they find home and the Father's embrace! truly no one shall be left behind, and the supernatural favour of the Lord is what wins hearts ❤ that it shall be easy, restful and light ⚡🌈💓  and that every youth shall just be so bold to love knowing they have been loved first ❤ 😊 it is a ministry of reconciliation that the Lord has given us!! and that means that the Lord does all the pursuing ⛈💓💓 in jesus name amen!! 

ENJOY YOURSELVES!!!
[7/9/19, 2:26:51 PM] Vanessa: Amen!!!
[7/9/19, 2:28:57 PM] Vanessa: Praying for you guys and the whole zoneX team and the whole church and everyone coming today!! Declaring that it shall be an anointed time set up by the Lord. That above the music and everything happening, Jesus shall minister personally to every single heart present, that every person who shows up shall have an encounter w Him and their lives shall be changed. You South people are a blessed bunch!! Go receive your own portion as well. And as you receive, the Lord shall use you for His glory 🙌🏻✨🌅
[7/9/19, 2:34:23 PM] Rox SOUTH: Also!!! Just some practical handles - amidst the many LOL ❤🌿👊

1. *NEVER ALONE* Encourage and remind your core/ youths to be open and reach out to other people’s friends :) don’t let that super evangeliser who brought 10 friends entertain them alone :))) we want no one left behind!!! And we are a ministry that lives loved and lives loving!!

2. *ONE ZONE* Be gracious, if you have 15 to 20 people and are unable to sit tgt, its ok! Try to let those with friends sit tgt with a few of your core to connect with them! As long as they are in the Father’s house, they will be blessed AMEN! 🏠 the zone x servers are just doing their best for us!! So let’s armourbear them as much as possible too ✨👊💕

3. *FOR THE 1* don’t worry about not being to connect to _every_ Friend cos that’s not the point haha, the Holy Spirit is  alive and active ☺👊💕 and He will lead you to the one that is needful!! And also you don’t have to take on the sole burdens cos 1) in the Lords hands, 2) activate your youths!!! 🥰


Go forth SOUTH SHEPHERDS !!! The Lord has graced you for such a time as this and it shall refresh your soul too 💓💓🌿🌿🌈🥳 it shall be Super awesome and let’s go up with great faith and hope - knowing our Abba is the miracle working God!!! 😎
[7/9/19, 2:35:15 PM] Rox SOUTH: Wahhhhh amen :”””))) thank u for being a prayer warrior for us in Canada 🙆🏻😊 thanks Vans!!

That truly our good shepherd goes before us and He anoints our head with oil that our cup may runneth over!!

And we shall walk in freedom and possess His promises for us with every step into the week - our workplaces and our schools and our homes shall be so blessed because Jesus radiates from our lives and His presence marks our Everyday!! And the Lord too is tending to our flock - that they shall be stead in His shalom peace and whatever chaos that surrounds them shall cease at His name✨💕 as we receive that spirit of freedom first! Restful🙂 return to smu sutd nus sim and all other workplaces!! In Jesus name amen 👊😎💒

[28/9/19, 8:25:51 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: HAHAHAHHAHAHA OKAY i send later :,)
[28/9/19, 8:33:58 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: yessssss

at the start of service ryan (already a youth) hadn’t confirmed if he was gonna bring his friend so when he came, i asked one of my core if ryan’s friend came and she said “yes his friend is here!!” so i was like wAH AWESOme okay tqJesus.

throughout service i kept feeling the Lord tell me to ask the NC if he received Christ after the service (which is v strange la bc i always feel v weird when i ask that qn esp since usually the answer i get is no lol) and i was like okay Jesus HHAHA. and during altar call i leaned to take a peek but he didn’t raise his hand so i thought “okay maybe not today hahahha”

after service ended, we gathered the cg to pray for the j1s and j2s for exams and the NB was beside me and i saw him raise his hands, then i thought “ohhh okay maybe he christian”

so after we prayed i just turned to him and said “hi you came with ryan today right?” and he said “hhahahaha oh yes!” then ryan popped up beside me too and i asked “oh how y’all know each other” etc and then i asked if they were staying for dinner or not and they said no they were gonna meet their mutual friends so i said oh okay cool see you again! at that moment, the Lord reminded me “ask him if he received Christ” and i was like......... ah okay Lord aiya at most he’ll say no lor. 

so i asked “btw did you say the prayer at the end of the service? the one to accept Jesus into your life” then the NB laugh laugh a bit then he nodded. and i was like WHAT. ryan was also shocked and he asked “eh whAT you said the prayer???” and the NB just kept laughing and he said “yea i just like look down and prayed lor and yea i receive i receive” then ryan and i were like “OMGGG EHHH welcome to the family broooo super awesome, welcome” then ryan told me that he wants to bring him to the welcome lounge and he told his friend “eh let’s go get the free stuff” HAHAHHA
[28/9/19, 8:35:19 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: oops a bit long :,) but yea waahh super awesome leh tqJesus!!! we connected him at the welcome lounge and i also exchanged contacts with him to follow up and invite him again :)

[2/10/19, 2:18:24 PM] Rox SOUTH: bumpity bump!! 😀

hello beloved under-shepherds (LOL) rmb to pm me when you've uploaded your cgm / need an extension okay :) 

_Lamentations 3_
22 The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;
    his mercies never come to an end;
23 they are new every morning;
    great is your faithfulness.
24 “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,
    “therefore I will hope in him.”

praying over us that as we remain in Him this week, our lives bear much fruit :) that above the winds and the waves and our need - our eyes shall be focused on His finished work :") and He turns every anxious thoughts towards Him - who is sovereign above all!! that our hearts shall arise in faith and press in for all the Lord has for us and our flock - apart from Him, we can do nothing, but with Him - there abounds the miracles!! 🙂 ❤ have a blessed day!! in jesus name amen 

let us know if u need prayer - we are here to stand b2b w one another!!
[2/10/19, 4:51:53 PM] Berwin ARROW: AMEN!!!

thanks for the reminder rox :)
[2/10/19, 6:45:05 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: amennnn tq rox!!
[7/10/19, 8:39:46 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Heyo, i cannot make it for service this saturday because i need to reccee some houses 😅 if i end early i will come down🙂
[8/10/19, 10:00:36 AM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys, for cluster this month we’re gonna try out having the youth planning team!! ☺ We’ll like ur help in nominating and inviting your youths if they’ll like to be involved in this! (It will still be open jio as they can co-opt their friends in but this is so we can spiral a recruitment heh)

Could yall pm me the names of your youths as well as which serving team they’ll like to be in, preferably by Thurs morning! 🙂

The available teams are: Welcome team, Decor and Ops! For welcome team and decor there isnt really a cap but for ops I’ll prefer to stick to 2 ppl, max 3! And I already have one on the team so maybe just 1/2 more ppl for ops! 👍🏻

If they do not know which team they wanna be in, is also oki, we’ll see which team has a need once we have all the names!! 

We’ll be meeting them before Arrow service *this Sat, shld be at 3pm*! Do let them know about this meeting as well as they’ll needa attend it! 🤗
[8/10/19, 10:04:42 AM] Rox SOUTH: ✨🥰🙏 thanks Megs!! If. U feel like u don’t have capacity to ask your youths can let me know too!! I can help u follow up :)) We not looking for Zai-ness, we are just looking for availability!! ❤😁
[8/10/19, 3:14:41 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hiiii everyoneeee!!!! thanks for keeping one another in prayer :')) truly blessed are we who dwell in unity!!  continuing from the sharing of anointing oil; i love how it describes in psalms 133 that unity is described as such - It is like oil poured out so richly that it flows from the head, to the beard, down to the very edge of the priest’s garments - and this unity is a blessing *from* the Lord himself :) and it is this unity like dew on Mt. Hermon, which will refreshing in our dry places and wilderness-spirits. So yesss :) we are #neveralone

Just wanna encourage y'all to keep one another in prayer as we are all in different seasons - be it highs or lows - the greatest blessing is that we get to do it with the Lord and by His grace. and praying over us that every weapon that is formed against us shall not prosper, and every spirit of stripe shall cease, and that we shall truly see His mercies are new every morning.
[8/10/19, 7:14:44 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: amen!! thank you rox ☺💞

[14/10/19, 3:43:08 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: hi guys wanna share with y’all smthg cool that happened at the recent servicE

about three weeks back at CG worship night, i gave a word for anyone who hasnt received the gift of tongues and one of my freshies raised her hand. in that moment i was like “omg Jesus i did not think this through... what now” HHAHAHAHHA

anyways, the CG laid hands and prayed together and she told me that she believes that she received the gift but she didnt still didnt pray. so i said isokay then :,) but it was still always on my heart for her to be able to pray in tongues, yet there were a lot of thoughts and condemnation– is it i pray wrong?? or was it the wrong word?? 

i told a friend about it and she told me how praying in tongues isnt about receiving the gift (as much as the Bible calls it a gift), but it’s simply about receiving the Holy Spirit and allowing the Spirit to release His power. 

fast forward to last saturday at Arrow, i wanted to give a word to one of the youths but i couldnt find her. instead, at that moment, Debs gave the word to those who wanted to receive the gift of tongues and lo aND BEHOLD i realised that the freshie who hadnt been able to pray before was right in front of me!! so i tapped her shoulder and held her hands and i said “don’t be afraid, i’ll pray with you :,) just let the Holy Spirit takeover“ 

then Debs started praying too and i prayed and for the first time wah i really felt this weight rest on me and it was like pulsating and i just saw it flowing through to the youth. 😭 

amidst the loud music i leaned in  and soon after i heard her praying in tongues too and i was like oHMY JESUS HAHAHAHA SHE DID IT. WOW LORD dis amazing and i sobbled.

We can *just send the emoji in the JC Leadership chat* HAHA :") 

declaring over us that we will not be busy with demands, but His light is laser and shall cause us to focus superabundantly on what is needful :) His hand of favour is upon us!! and it is because through His mercy, we have this ministry, we won't lose heart but see to it that in all we do it shall be so spirit-directed, God's light revealing the person and loveliness of Jesus in all we do and see! In Jesus name amen 🔆⚡👑

HI SOUTH LEADERS, to facilitate the upcoming cluster's breakout session, I need y'all to indicate a short 2/3 liner descriptor of yourself to the list below. (Note: This list should only include the names of those who are going to be present at cluster, so plis add/ remove your name accordingly. :) ) Some guiding points:
   1. The season you think you are in now
   2. A failure/ lesson that has marked your journey with the Lord

I know it's a little last minute but please try to fill this in by TONIGHT so that we can get the form out to the youths ASAP (tmr) ((hopefully hhehe)) :) If you cant think of a descriptor for yourself, then ask someone to help you think of one!! Overlaps are also okay, so this gives the youths more options :,,)

[16/10/19, 12:11:07 PM] Berwin ARROW: Ok hi everyone :-)

For the leaders facilitating breakout, what y’all can think about for the descriptions we are gonna give to to the youths is these:

1) for “what has marked your journey with the lord” don’t focus on the *style* you go to The Lord, but on the *experiences* you have gone through with The Lord// nothing wrong with putting down how you went to the Lord, but try to put down experiences so the youths can try and relate better 

2) for “current season”, once again more explanation is good, but you can also put down the way you go to The Lord

Key pointers:

- categorise your descriptions into
1) what has marked your journey 
2) what is your current season with

- the youths will pick the leaders they can relate the most to based on past/current season, but don’t worry the focus is not from the youths drawing from us, it’s only really to serve as a way to breakup the youths from their CGs, to serve cluster’s purpose for bonding 

- the breakout qsns will still be designed to draw out from the youths 
1) what their prayer life’s look like
2) for them to glean and encourage each other abt what a life of prayer looks like
3) unveil Jesus

Things that still need modifying 
- ldrs description (we can help each other out later tonight)
- breakout qsns
- youth to share for svc recap
- length of cluster (2.5 hrs too tight?)

[17/10/19, 9:42:16 AM] Rox SOUTH: Can send out :) unless there are other things u @6598712012 are currently walking out that u think can relate w the youths? :) cos I’m not sure if marriage will be on their minds haha but no harm putting ahaha they can related to what marked!!
[17/10/19, 9:45:55 AM] Kai Jie ARROW: @6592323502 i thought about that too, but it is heavily overlapped by the rest. I am looking more at relationship as a whole. If it is not aligned to the over cluster theme i will change ☺
[17/10/19, 9:49:05 AM] Rox SOUTH: Overlaps are okay!! But if u are looking at relationship as a whole it’s fine :)

The main point for these profiles is just so the youths can talk about experiences that relate to them. And the main point of the breakout is to draw out how they involve the lord in these things :)
[17/10/19, 9:49:20 AM] Rox SOUTH: Okay!! Can send out the link hehe thanks for your labour of love everyone ❤

[19/10/19, 6:07:14 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: otherwise it’s good!
[19/10/19, 8:56:24 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: hello here are the notes from our debrief just now :)
[19/10/19, 8:56:28 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: leaders briefing 

kai jie - writing the prayers didnt know when to do it. execution wise not v good. good idea but the youths didnt know what to do with it. intro to the wall was brief. intentionally draw attention to it. 

welcome - cute with kieroy. managed it well, grabbed kieroy. goal for berwin to not be with him.

sermon recap - pretty clear atleast know the heart behind it. felt a bit long berwins recap rich. a lot going on. did great even without notes! 

breakout - very fresh. very different. the purpose was met. what can we do different from service and cg. administrative was good! make it more season specific - how we phrase it ref more to walk with the Lord. 

take note of girl boy mixture. calista only girl in the relationship group & ethan wong only boy in rachs group. 

too heavy overlap will there be confusion?? very distinct areas might be better. why overlap is okay if not too big. 

can do it maybe topical wise next time!! 

when we see jesus in his grace, He sees us in our faith. point them away from their flesh and uncomfortable feelings hear them out and minister to them - boy girl unavoidable 

holy comm - not about saying more for the sake of saying more that t mins is for you to step up. ask the Lord what do you want me to do in that 5 mins. the minister geta ministered to in the process of prepping. 

sharing - style of slides very uni style. lesser words. 

mikestand etc move away after practice so dont block the verses. 

worship - lifting up their hands!! leaders moved to the front for worship. 

exhortation - was great! MIRACLE! it was like a rap. rachel lee in the house. 

praying for one another. some youths still go together with who they already know. maybe give a number at the start a bit mechanical but works

what was rox heart? pray for someone that they didn't know OR not from cg it was still a win

in general - ops timing!! end by 4.55ish felt so bad for the decor team. look at the timing better. 

there was a spirit of expectancy which is what made cg different
[19/10/19, 9:09:05 PM] Rox SOUTH: THANKS NAY 🙆🏻❤ so excellent!!

Life and life more abundantly is our portion. Today, as we step into the day ahead - know that He has gone ahead and is our rear guard.

See y’all later and bring a notebook and pen along :) no speed dating today (next time) but we will still have fun 😆

https://youtu.be/_OxiAenjaww

- sometimes we get caught up in our day-to-day frustrations, and ask where is the Lord in all this? 

- that even when we cannot see - He sees, and His ways are far above our own. Drawing a beautiful plan all our lives just to bless us and to show us the depth of His unending love for us. 

- if an earthly father could do this, what more our heavenly Father? 

- And it speaks to me alot cos I know I am walking through deep ends of unbelief... but hey!! in our unbelief (as He helps us w this), seeing Him in our lives, despite things being hard, the Lord sees this as we believing in Him already!! And He accounts this to us for righteousness!! & despite all the unbelief in His promises - He is still faithful and true. 

Have a blessed time w your youths SA / have a blessed rest CJ~ the lord is with you, you shall not fall to the ground :)

Hey giant-slayers, as you start your papers tomorrow, I want you to know that we’re all praying and rooting for you guys! These giants shall be bread for you because the Lord is the one fighting your battles. In this year of the latter rain, you shall experience such harvests of joy, peace, hope even as you take your papers and be filled with the wisdom and understanding that comes from God because you have the mind of Christ! Most of all, your future is so so bright because Jesus is the one holding your future (not the A level cert). 😎 

Love, Ps Dan. 👊🏻

[7/11/19, 12:05:30 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hey y’all!! I don’t know about how you all have been feeling about serving. But I for one have been feeling great resistance and a very natural sianness about cluster and just any serving meeting in general lol. So I’m just gonna share some good things that have been spoken to me w more faith than I definitely feel - but Darren shared w me that just like how Elijah prayed seven times and saw a little cloud the size of a hand, there is a place for us to repeat His promises, the things we have heard in our spirit over what we see in the natural. That it is completely unnatural to turn to the Lord but the cool part is - that it is not on us to turn to Him. 

So this we shall declare over us - that joy peace and rest and fruits of the spirit is our portion! That we get to see the Lord afresh and know Him so intimately in this time on Earth, in these tiny windows, to see Him stretch and expand our faith and to know in all fullness the depth of grace we receive and the love He has for us. I just declare against any Attack in believing that even as we have entered into a time of the spiritual w 22/22, our hearts shall be so strengthened and built up in the loveliness of the person of Jesus - that everything that is of the flesh shall now to His name. Every demand and feelings of being overwhelmed/ underwhelmed shall be so excited and in wonder by the supply and promises He has for us. That as we are loved, we are led. And I just thank u Jesus that you cause South to be set apart and unite us in the spirit!! That as You dwell in us, our hearts shall daily delight in your sweet presence. In Jesus name amen! 💖☺🌈
[7/11/19, 12:06:42 AM] Rox SOUTH: Oops longer message than I thought it’ll be cos caffeine-induced LOL. But just wanna say Thank You guys 💓❤😊 for your labour of love and work of faith - the Lord is a debtor to no man and there is surely so much more grace for this!! 🥳🤩💖

[16/11/19, 5:48:31 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Ok
[16/11/19, 6:04:21 PM] Berwin ARROW: Ok now!
[16/11/19, 6:41:22 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Worship cluster feedback

Intro: 
✅Keroy is bolder
Clearer instructions for gathering people together

Rox part:
✅Roxanne did not rely on script.
Slow down because you have more time. 

Slides:
Needs improvement. Design wise - Use canva

General:
The clock is not visible for worship leader, speaker so they cant keep on time. Get a digital countdown timer.
Need more ops people to handle lights.
Set of protocols to designate front/back light and curtain panels.
Get a youth to record each leader’s part

Visuals:
Prep youth to take care of unexpected cases (i.e. overrun - blank slide maybe)

Worship:
Sound adjustment - if michaela sings ask her to put the mic closer to her mouth. 

Rachlee:
✅Flow in the spirit

Berwin:
✅Sharing his life/ very real
Mindful of time.
Rearrange sharing: Verse - Personal story - Verse (recap) - End of Song
Dont touch & go on verses especially if you dont have enough time.

Holy Comm:
✅Getting youths to lead in own cg - more intimate. Also give them the opportunity to take ownership.

Davyn & David:
Make sure they get the right memo. Davyn’s style was sharing more than declaration/exhortation.
✅David’s part was good

Alter call:
Dont use the word “right”
Dont need to repeat word for word
One suggestion: talk to our youths about why we do it on cluster when there is no new believers. So that they can get our youths to invite friends to be saved.

Programme:
Plan with buffer: i.e. 450 end when ballroom ends 530
[16/11/19, 7:14:15 PM] Rox SOUTH: THANK U KAI JIE FOR UR ADMIN SKILLS this is awesome!!
[16/11/19, 8:30:28 PM] Rox SOUTH: Does anyone have a recording of Berwin leading as u find me!! I accidentally deleted mine :”)

His arm is not too short to save and is mighty!! He shall make every step so grace filled and these days will be a testimony of his goodness and faithfulness! his wisdom abounds over us and we shall walk this season w a different spirit in Jesus name amen

[27/11/19, 10:05:22 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Odele's?
[27/11/19, 10:05:25 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hahaaha
[27/11/19, 10:05:51 PM] Megan ARROW: But function room would mean that a certain amount of the budget is gone
[27/11/19, 10:06:00 PM] Megan ARROW: And home more cosy imo
[27/11/19, 10:06:02 PM] Megan ARROW: Thats far

[27/11/19, 10:07:11 PM] Megan ARROW: I think can think about the atmosphere of the party more, like whether is cosy or not cus honestly going to a function room isnt v cosy 😅
[27/11/19, 10:07:13 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I love it when it's far

[8/12/19, 5:18:47 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Yknow for the events that were not recorded (the yellow box ones)
[8/12/19, 5:18:59 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Are we supposed to edit it back on noah?
[8/12/19, 5:19:06 PM] Loocurse ARROW: I can't access mysheep :(
[8/12/19, 5:19:10 PM] Loocurse ARROW: It's damn buggy
[8/12/19, 9:00:02 PM] Megan ARROW: Yea can settle it via NOAH!!
[9/12/19, 10:46:25 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Done!
[9/12/19, 10:49:27 AM] Megan ARROW: Do you have any youths that are supposed to be on that list? That they’re supposed to be eligible for camp but they’re not there?
[9/12/19, 10:56:45 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: sorry @6596730555 i havent had time to sit down and look at the doc :,) will try to do so by tmr and update you!!! we have till 20th right
[9/12/19, 11:08:55 AM] Megan ARROW: Is oki!! Yea is till 20th but was thinking we could try to check it by the end of this week, then can consolidate and send out the email!! :”)
[10/12/19, 12:25:33 AM] Megan ARROW: Hey guys, when yall check the attendance, take note that its from Feb-Nov 2019 and the following events are excluded
1. June CG
2. August Cluster
3. Sept CG (Zone X)
[10/12/19, 12:26:12 AM] Megan ARROW: Theres also a column that has been added in the spreadsheets (our own attendance tracking), to show if they are eligible for camp or not based on the events counted for attendance
[10/12/19, 12:28:36 AM] Megan ARROW: If you havent added the attendance into the attendance spreadsheets pls do so!! It would help you to make sure that the attendance for camp is accurate :") 
Not too sure if a new spreadsheet would be sent out later on that has a list of all the youths and the events that they've attended as well, but filling up the spreadsheet would really help cus even if there are errors for those not eligible, we should still rectify it cus it can affect waiting list!!
[11/12/19, 5:33:22 PM] Rachel Koh: Yo hi guys we need help w our christmas party planning if yall have any youths who are available can ask them and put their name down?
[11/12/19, 5:34:05 PM] Rachel Koh: sorry its a bit rushed but can maybe fill up the list by tmr 12pm?

[17/12/19, 7:15:39 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey leaders:) as you are aware *CAMP REGO 2020* processes have started! 

One really part of the process is identifying youths who need *financial assistance for camp*. If they don’t submit their forms *by the end of this week*, we won’t be able to consider them for financial aid.

*Please help make sure as many of our youths can go for camp as possible by:*
1) Doing a general check/shout out in the CG chat for them to PM you if they need the application form 
2) Check in on youths who you know have financial difficulties previously 

The forms & supporting documents should then be emailed/mailed directly to Broderick.sim@newcreation.org.sg 😊 thanks guys! ☀ 

The gracious admin maestro Broderick has extended the timeline as we noticed that the number of applicants is much lower than last year so please help us check in 🙌🏻

[18/12/19, 12:13:01 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Okay so that means they don't have to meet this deadline here right?

South Safehouse shall grow from strength to strength in Spirit and in Truth, from seed to sequoia, in knowledge and in intimacy of who the person of Jesus is in their lives. Marked by a different spirit, they shall be lighthouses in their spheres of influence, beholding Him with Hearts transformed by His grace and love that reaches out.

In Jesus name amen! 😊😌🙏

Whether you’ve been dreading the CNY season or looking forward to it,  I just wanna declare that you shall see restoration and greater glory in the things u find difficult to trust for - be it a family members salvation, or just peaceful and joyful interactions with your relatives! There shall be much forgiveness abounding in your hearts :) as the Lord soothes all wounds in your families! And there shall be so many Qarah moments of divine favour!! 🌈🌈 and I pray that the conversations shall edify!! 🙏😊 

Just wanted to share something that touched me: (1) my mum and I had an unusually deep and touching moment before she flew off to HK for CNY, and (2) I could invest into my dad and move past the disappointment to talk to him normally! so ya!! Trusting God with you all that you shall see breakthroughs and celebrating with you all 🙌💖 AND OF COURSE TO PROSPER WITH THE HONG BAOS HEHEH
[25/1/20, 9:46:19 AM] Rox SOUTH: OH YES AND U AND UR FAM ARE KEPT IN SUPERNATURAL HEALTH!! As Jesus is, so are we in this world!! And no weapon formed against us shall prosper!! Also all the fats from feasting shall have no place in our bodies amen!!!

Every week, the one who replies the slowest has to do twenty push ups, own time own target 😛😚😚 #crossfit
[3/2/20, 8:34:13 AM] Rox SOUTH: Let’s welcome Joelle HAHHA ❤🥰
[3/2/20, 8:41:51 AM] Joelle ARROW CJ: Haha hellu:)
[3/2/20, 8:46:13 AM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: hellooo joelle 👋🏾
[3/2/20, 8:54:39 AM] Rox SOUTH: ALSO!!! 💥 GOOD MORNING FRIENDOS💥

I was really inspired by a lil nugget Pastor shared on Sunday about *A S K I N G* and how although there were other disciples on the boat, Peter walked on water simply because he asked!! and we have a portion and privilege of asking in terms of heaven’s supply!! 🤪🌈🙌

💖So just wanted to declare over us, South and our families and friends that truly no weapon formed against us shall prosper. That we are 120% safe from every pestilence under the shadow of His wings! And no novel corona virus can touch a molecule of our hairs, and every sickness and fear shall flee seven ways and we are kept in the fullness of life and health! 🌈

This week may seem like a busy week😝 ahem NAOMI IS AT HER FIRST DAY OF WORK AND RAELEE IS PENDEZA-ING ahem 😝but I just wanted to encourage us all that we shall 😀see His new mercies and fresh grace manifest so evidently in our lives! that as we take each step on this road of grace with the Lord, He shall not only surprise us with the daily whispher of love, but also, lead us in His ways that every land we tread on shall be divinely in the right place and right time to bring us great victories! that the song of our heart shall pound with “if God is for us, who can be against us?” And there shall be such a sure knowing of His presence in our lives!  In Jesus name, amen 🇸🇬💓 have a blessed day 🙆🏻🤪
[3/2/20, 8:59:34 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: AMMMENNNN truly if God is for us who can be against 😭 tanku Rox
[3/2/20, 9:35:12 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Amen!!!!
[3/2/20, 9:40:26 AM] Rachel Koh: Yess amen!!
[3/2/20, 9:40:37 AM] Rachel Koh: Hellu joellee
[3/2/20, 9:45:30 AM] Rox SOUTH: ❤ in the spirit of *a s k I n g & receiving boldly*, this week is the week that the Freshies are joining us and we are having the FIRST JC service of the year~ so let’s press in and be prayed up in the Spirit in the lead up to service and ride the spiritual momentum of fresh grace together🌈🥰  

There’s gonna be a number of admin things to take note for tmr *4 FEB* 🙌♥️🤩 

1) CONTACTING FRESHIES 
This is posting results day!! (I think...)
• I will be passing the contacts to the respective groups (CJ / SA) when I receive them!
• PDPA guidelines apply, relevant information to the relevant stakeholders 
• Megan and Naomi will help me take charge amongst the respective schools okay- namely ensuring that the contacts are spread out amongst y’all and the Freshies have been contacted.
• let me know if u are Super busy at school tmr hehe :) it’s cool if u are! 
• let’s endeavour to be diligent in contacting them and inviting them for service 💖the Freshies would probably be in aSuper vulnerable frame of mind so let’s remind them of the lord’s extravagant love for them :-) u never know how a minute could change their lives~ 

_Declaring that there shall be much harvest and  120% retention and arrow shall be so supernaturally attractive! Our nets are tightened and doors opened by the Lord. Not a man or a mouse shall slip through the cracks. The SLs shall have so many Qarah moments too 🙌😝_ 

2) A CAMP REGISTRATION 
• the hour has come once more! remind ur youths to sign up :)
• wishlist will also open here 💥🤩

Thank you for taking the time to do this and declaring the Lord shall multiply the time back to you :”) 

Give me a 👍 when read 😊

[5/2/20, 3:41:51 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: The NOAH link isn't for camp rego as the rego is hosted on brushfire. So even if they can see it on NOAH they won't be able to access the rego. :)

[7/2/20, 7:47:58 PM] Rox SOUTH: Dear Arrow Leaders! 🐑
Please note the following updates since we’re now at DORSCON Orange:

• *Services and CGs will proceed as planned* as there is no ban on mass gatherings
• *The same guidelines apply* - if someone who has been to China and/or is feeling unwell should not participate in activities. 
• *Temperature taking at CGs is not a must*, however, CGLs should conduct visual health checks, and to turn away those with respiratory symptoms such as cough or runny nose
• You are *encouraged to do mass prayers* rather than one-on-one ministering. 

Even as we exercise wisdom in keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe, let’s continue to partake of the Holy Communion and proclaim His promise of protection in Psalm 91 over ourselves, our families and those affected by this.
[7/2/20, 7:48:35 PM] Rox SOUTH: Please send the following message to your youths by tonight :) 

Hey Arrow Youths!

We can't wait to see u for POLITE / JC Svc tomorrow! 🎊🕺Here are some pointers: 

*1) LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA)*
✈️ If u visited Mainland China within the last 2 weeks and are on LOA from school, *pls PM your CGL* and take LOA from Arrow too. 

*2) NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS*
🤧 If you feel unwell or have any flu-like symptoms (fever, cough or runny nose, etc.), pls see a doctor. Stay home and rest till you're all well. We'll keep you in our prayers~

*3) HEALTH CHECKS @ Arrow*
🕙 Come earlier to facilitate the temperature checks! 
👨🏻‍⚕ Pls note that if you turn up with flu-like symptoms, we'll ask you to see a doctor and rest up at home. 

Let's exercise wisdom in this season while we continue to partake of the Holy Communion and declare Psalm 91 upon ourselves and families. 🙌🏻🙏🏻 His divine health and protection are our portion!!

Blessings,
Arrow

[10/2/20, 12:02:02 AM] Vanessa: The plan will be up by Tuesday 2359 (by the youths), and then we’ll finalise it by Wednesday (2359). Can take a look at the doc in the drive for some info, but all plans may be subject to change cos of the orange alert :-)
[10/2/20, 9:34:27 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Thanks vans :))
‎[10/2/20, 1:00:43 PM] Rox SOUTH: ‎image omitted
[10/2/20, 1:05:34 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey everyone! Just wanted to be transparent and show you all Debs’ (thank u!!) input :) 

Thank you all for your concern and running with me despite the potential for changes! 

I have decided to *NOT* have a cluster event as I feel like there is still much fear and uncertainty wrt DORSCON, so we will *POSTPONE* and use another cg day when things look better for this bash! This does not mean that we forsake the assembly of the church, yes we rebuke the spirit of fear amen,  and we will gather for *CG*! 

Primarily, to armourbear the nation and the parents whom children we have been entrusted, and given that Higher Ed has cancelled events >50 (Although government guidelines for DORSCON is actually <1000), and inter-school competitions have been affected, I think it would be wiser to meet as CGs and trust the Lord that He is still forging the spirit of Unity!!
[10/2/20, 1:06:33 PM] Loocurse ARROW: O’rite this sits well with me!! :) thanks rox!
[10/2/20, 1:08:58 PM] Megan ARROW: Oki noted!! Thanks Rox! :”)
[10/2/20, 1:10:46 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: okiee
[10/2/20, 1:10:47 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: oki! thanks rox noted :-)
[10/2/20, 1:42:47 PM] Rox SOUTH: With that being said, we still need to decide what to do about the Freshies, as I still feel that it will also be tough to hold one CJ and one SA - due to venue constraints, and it is still a rather large group 😅. 

There a few options we could do, so perhaps we can do a short call on Monday / Tuesday night what you all think is right to your spirit (so pls pray in the Spirit today HAHA)?   
I’m personally okay with both but I want to see

Option A: 
By faith delegate the Freshies to the different CGs. And then have CG!
- especially since this year we don’t have that many Freshies as of yet, so we can just go by faith and proportion!

Option B: 
Meet within schools and not reshuffle the Freshies 
- but the con is that it will be quite a  large group still and I don’t know if it’s will be comfortable for parents to gather so many at once- esp since some schools have started elearning (like SA) ☺

_Im free for a call!_

- but the con is that it will be quite a  large group still and I don’t know if it’s will be comfortable for parents to gather so many at once- esp since some schools have started elearning (like SA) ☺

Declaring that this is not a situation based on natural circumstance but the Lord’s hands is in the midst :)) thanks all ❤

(There is a prepared CGM on B2B community which I will release here soon! 😊)
[10/2/20, 2:44:50 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: With that being said, we still need to decide what to do about the Freshies, as I still feel that it will also be tough to hold one CJ and one SA - due to venue constraints, and it is still a rather large group 😅. 

There a few options we could do, so perhaps we can do a short call on Monday / Tuesday night what you all think is right to your spirit (so pls pray in the Spirit today HAHA)?   
I’m personally okay with both but I want to see

Option A: 
By faith delegate the Freshies to the different CGs. And then have CG!
- especially since this year we don’t have that many Freshies as of yet, so we can just go by faith and proportion!

Option B: 
Meet within schools and not reshuffle the Freshies

e.g. 

CG A - 🦁
CG B - 🥊
[14/2/20, 8:38:16 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Please send the following message to your youths before CG :) 

Hey Arrow Youths!

We can't wait to see u at Care Group this weekend! 🎊🕺Here are some pointers: 

*1) LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA)*
✈️ If u visited Mainland China within the last 2 weeks and are on LOA from school, *pls PM your CGL* and take LOA from Arrow too. 

*2) NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS*
🤧 If you feel unwell or have any flu-like symptoms (fever, cough or runny nose, etc.), pls see a doctor. Stay home and rest till you're all well. We'll keep you in our prayers~

*3) HEALTH CHECKS @ CG*
🕙 *Bring your personal thermometer!* We'll be taking temperature as a CG before we start! 
👨🏻‍⚕ Pls note that if you turn up with flu-like symptoms, we'll ask you to see a doctor and rest up at home. 

Let's exercise wisdom in this season while we continue to partake of the Holy Communion and declare Psalm 91 upon ourselves and families. 🙌🏻🙏🏻 His divine health and protection are our portion!!

Blessings,
Arrow

—— 
Hey Arrow Giant Slayers! As you receive your 'A' Levels results tomorrow, I want you to know that the entire Arrow is behind you, cheering and rooting for you. I know that our amazing God will answer exceedingly above and beyond what you can ask or think. Have an early night and go with the consciousness that your Heavenly Father loves you so dearly! 😊 I truly believe that as you bask in that love, you will even have the chance to be an extension of His love to your friends. I am extremely proud of you and I know that your best days are right out in front of you! 😊👊🏻

Love,
Pastor Daniel

Hey Arrow Youths!

We can't wait to see u for POLITE / JC Svc tomorrow! 🎊🕺Here are some pointers: 

*1) LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA)*
✈️ If u visited Mainland China within the last 2 weeks and are on LOA from school, *pls PM your CGL* and take LOA from Arrow too. *If you have been or are on LOA please help us by filling up this form bit.ly/zone-loa-qo*

*2) NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS*
🤧 If you feel unwell or have any flu-like symptoms (fever, cough or runny nose, etc.), pls see a doctor. Stay home and rest till you're all well. We'll keep you in our prayers~

*3) HEALTH CHECKS @ Arrow*
🕙 Come earlier to facilitate the temperature checks! We have an upgraded temp screening system 🙌🏻
👨🏻‍⚕ Pls note that if you turn up with flu-like symptoms, we'll ask you to see a doctor and rest up at home. 

*We also have a letter fm Ps Dan 👊🏻for your parents regarding the measures that we are taking. Do share it with them in case they are wondering!* Let's exercise wisdom in this season while we continue to partake of the Holy Communion and declare Psalm 91 upon ourselves and families. 🙌🏻🙏🏻 His divine health and protection are our portion!!

Blessings,
Arrow

[24/2/20, 10:10:59 AM] Rox SOUTH: Thanks guys for your labour of love and investment in time :) 

I’ve been meditating on this verse that Debs (And Ber shared again) shared with us and I declare it over our coming week too! ❤🙆🏻

Amos 9:13-15 The Message (MSG)
 “Yes indeed, it won’t be long now.” God’s Decree.

“Things are going to happen so fast your head will swim, one thing fast on the heels of the other. You won’t be able to keep up. Everything will be happening at once—and *everywhere you look, blessings* ! Blessings like wine pouring off the mountains and hills. I’ll make everything right again for my people Israel:

“They’ll rebuild their ruined cities.
They’ll plant vineyards and drink good wine.
They’ll work their gardens and eat fresh vegetables.
And I’ll plant them, plant them on their own land.
They’ll never again be uprooted from the land I’ve given them.”
God, your God, says so.


This week, wherever we walk is promised land! Land that we did not toil or strive for, but land that has been freely given to us! ✌🥳 that when our hearts are overwhelmed, we will look up and see that the Lord is Lord over all our lives :) and His promise for us is one of Rest, a spirit filled and spirit led life! ✨❤
[24/2/20, 10:11:45 AM] Rox SOUTH: You are appreciated 💫🔥💥 and the Lord sees what man doesn’t :)

[24/2/20, 11:31:16 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hey Arrow Leaders!! 😊 The leaders of our younger brothers and sisters need some help as rooming buddies at DARE Legacy Camp this year (22-26 June)!!! 😁🐙

We would like to extend this invitation to *you AND youths whom you recommend*. This could be an opportunity to expose those who might be a good fit serving in DARE, with no obligations. For those of us already serving, it’s more to help lend support to the DARE team!! 😁😁 #OneZone 🏠 This is really a privilege we’re extending for some of us to get to go for 2 camps. 😄

Additionally, the cost of this camp will be covered for you if you take on the above serving capacity. We need all the help we can get so if y’all/your youths are able to serve in this capacity to bless the next generation, *do PM me* by Sun, 15 Mar. Official registration will follow only after. 

If u need more clarification, just PM me too 😊 thanks guys!! 😁

[27/2/20, 11:02:21 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hey Arrow Fam bam,

During this season of the COVID-19 situation, we want to exercise wisdom as a church and focus our efforts and energy on the church’s core activities. (_Such core activities include our Sunday services, youth services and care groups_). 🙇🏻‍♂🙇🏻‍♀

In light of this, non-critical meetings like leaders and servers’ meetings at all levels will be temporarily put on hold till end of May. We are currently exploring an online option for some of these meetings so watch this space! 🔥

The exception to the above is if the meeting is required to support the core activity of the church (e.g. worship practice for services, service ops prep, post service debrief etc.) Your O/CR/TR will work out the details with you. 

*NEW UPDATES ON OUR TRAVEL ADVISORY*

📍In line with the Ministry of Health’s advisory, *if you have travelled to Mainland China or Daegu and/or Cheongdo of the Republic of Korea* within the last two weeks, please refrain from attending any church services/activities for a period of 14 days from the date of return to Singapore.

📍*DARE/Arrow*: In an effort to take additional precaution with our children/youth/elderly, we'll be adopting the following approach for DARE & Arrow for overseas travel: *If you travelled to any country (incl. JB, for any duration of time) within the last 2 weeks, please refrain from attending any DARE/Arrow services/activities for a period of 14 days from the date of return to Singapore*.

Thank you for partnering with us in this even as we continue to pray and stand against COVID-19 situation, and ask for the Lord’s wisdom and guidance in all this.✨
[27/2/20, 11:03:11 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hi my pals ❤😊take note of the travel notice ya for arrow leaders!! Let me know if u have been to malaysia (like jb!!) or other countries in the past 2 weeks... or if u have travel plans!
[27/2/20, 2:25:06 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: sorry i sent it to the CG chat before i knew it was only for leaders :,)

[27/2/20, 2:52:32 PM] Rox SOUTH: Oh HAHHAHA
[27/2/20, 2:52:43 PM] Rox SOUTH: It’s okay Rach!! Can just delete and resend the appropriate one
[27/2/20, 2:53:47 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey Arrow Youths!

We can't wait to see u at Care Group this weekend! 🎊🕺Here are some pointers: 

*1) LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA)*
✈️ If u visited *Mainland China / Daegu and/or Cheongdo of the Republic of Korea* within the last 2 weeks and/or are on LOA from school/NS, *pls PM your CGL* and take LOA from Arrow too. 

*2) NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS*

👨🏻‍⚕ Pls note that if you turn up with flu-like symptoms, we'll ask you to see a doctor and rest up at home. 

Let's exercise wisdom in this season while we continue to partake of the Holy Communion and declare Psalm 91 upon ourselves and families. 🙌🏻🙏🏻 His divine health and protection are our portion!!

Blessings,
Arrow

[28/2/20, 11:29:59 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hi guys! *pls keep this at our level first cos it hasn’t been announced to the youths*

some AA updates!! 
In light of COVID19, we will not be able to gather the youths and run Arrow Academy physically. However, we still want to give the youths an opportunity to attend Arrow Academy.  

💻 As such, we have changed the AA program to be an online course, where the youths can tune in to the different modules from their homes. The post-AA serving programme will still continue as we want to give them a hands-on experience. 

In addition, we will splitting the youths into groups based on cluster to keep it interactive. 

*NOTE TO YOU DEAR LEADERS* ❤

If you are interested in tuning in to some of the modules, do *PM* me by Sunday this week so y’all can be added into the stream.

Do pray & believe with the Arrow full time staff that our youths will still be blessed & receive so much from this run of AA inspite of all the changes!!!! ✨✌☺❤💫

[1/3/20, 10:44:58 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey guys:) _rmb the mportant message to all leaders regarding COVID-19 Updates? _🤩🤩

Well, for these two weeks we aka ARROW are *adopting more stringent measures and reviewing from there* .

We will be *limiting our physical meetings *(including cluster/team leaders huddles) to *essential* ones. That means from now till May, pending review, we will meet F2F for South Leaders Meeting ONCE a month.

*So Rox, what does this all mean? *

1⃣ I will share with you all more info soon! *FIRST things first, * for this week, we will be trying out South Leaders Meeting *online* (yay!! On our fav Skype??? HAHAHHA) Lets set aside time to be together and not to forsake the assembling, esp we try out new mediums! ✌😃✌ would still love to hear from y’all and feed on the word together + share with y’all impt administrative announcements and how things would look like the next few months!! 

Understand there’s quite a bit of shifting this season due to COVID-19, so appreciate y’all v much and thank you for running with us ☺ the lord shall give us so much grace for grace!!!

2⃣ let’s arrange a time to meet online this week, after Wed - let’s try our best to set aside a 2hr block okay :) ❤🥰❤ I’ll answer more questions here too!! 

*we will do the poll on Tele okay* ! 

Love y’all and will send a prayer here soon hehe
[1/3/20, 11:42:49 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hope y’all felt ministered to this week by Pastor!

https://youtu.be/stjOIflP_1g

Nothing like being in His presence to be reminded of His perfect love that drives every fear away... 😊 was rlly encouraged by what he shared, briefly, about that as we pray in the Spirit, it is like fragrance of incense going up to the Lord and felt like the Lord rlly wanted us to press in for 22/22 this season :) ✨🥰

This week, I declare that we shall be kept in the shadow of His wings, close to his heart, and protected! that as we embark of completing our assignments or respond to plan changes, our God shall keep our eyes fully on Him, He who will prosper every work and show us His purposes of good towards us :) it is the Lord who directs our steps, who leads us besides still waters and restores our soul. Though our outer courts may be busy with activity, our lives are inner courts, sanctuaries of peace and rest, knowing the Lord has dearly and surely provided all our needs according to His riches. We are children of God and shall live out that life of rested royalty this week, glowing with Jesus glow :) He sets us apart with His favour and grace!!

“The steps of a [good and righteous] man are directed and established by the Lord,
And He delights in his way [and blesses his path]. When he falls, he will not be hurled down,
Because the Lord is the One who holds his hand and sustains him.” psalm 37:23-24 (ampc)

[5/3/20, 2:24:29 PM] Rox SOUTH: Anyway Hi guys!!  I have something on my heart that I would like to do with you all :”) I like to call this 🔥 LOVE DARTS 💥!!

I think something the lord has been bringing me on is a journey of rediscovering what His love and grace means! 
 
_1 John 4:11 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. _

And something I like to do as we close the last 10 day of 22/22 is to keep one another in His love and in each other’s prayers because it’s the most practical and spiritual thing we can do for each other :)

So in the next 10 days, after we spending time communing with the Lord, shall we also build up one another in prayer, and pray for ONE assigned person each day!!! :) it can be after 1 minute or 22 minutes of praying in the spirit- and we will all declare over here on this chat and say amen together 🙌💪🥰
 
Day : Person we are all praying over!

Just wanted to declare this verse over you!

Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.

Just felt that the Lord wanted to remind u that your future and career is in His hands. Truly, He lights the way. How good is the path laid out for the one He loves!  Declaring that you shall remain in His perfect love, knowing He provides in over abundance. That even as you tend to the many gardens of your life- know that the Gardener tends to every detail, far better than you can! His grace is sure and it is steadfast in your life :) that all shall see His hans in yours!

[7/3/20, 9:14:29 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hey Vans! Just saw this image of baby you and JESUS walking with one another in the cool of day, and as the scene changes from beautiful forests, to 
expansive deserts, the Lord is the one who leads you on on the path to go, and it is not a hurried journey, but a journey where he takes the time to show you little wonders along the way- from the colours of a purple sunrise to the flowers blooming on the cactus, and the way the light falls! The Lord desires intimacy with you, and you will experience Him in such a fresh, daily wonder and grace! kept in the most exciting portion of belovedness! And as you learn a new rhythm of grace this year, be it in ministry or in life, the Lord doesn’t want you to despise the small beginnings but to treasure the loudness of His voice that rings so clearly in your heart. His word is sharper than any 2 edged sword and He gives you the gift of discernment and free favour! Amen 💌📪

Pastor said this and it’s a great way to explain the significance of the oil:

Encourage y’all to also encourage your youths to look out for testimonies in the coming week be it protection, healing and good success!! 🌞🌟💌💥💫 the lord is stirring our faith!

“For the Lord will comfort [Rach], He will comfort all her waste places; He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord;
Joy and gladness will be found in it, Thanksgiving and the voice of melody.” Isaiah 51:3

He’s not done with you yet Rach. He’s drawing near and comforting all your places of lack. He’s causing buds to spring forth, and trees to bear fruit. It is in your desert that He makes His garden! It is in your wilderness that He makes His masterpiece! For your mouth to spring forth overflowing testimonies, that is His portion for you ☺

Just felt that the Lord wanted to remind you even if your sight wavers at the big demands of school or expectations you have about the future ahead, the Lord wants you to place your hope in Him! You are His precious jar of clay and it is the gaps that His glory shines through. there is grace in the grind, because He is in the midst and restoring to you joy and rest. ❤️ For when we make much of Jesus and His Finished Work, God will make much of us. He is so proud of you Rach!! For all that you are 😊🌞💫

_Let’s all pray over Rae Leeee today!_
[11/3/20, 10:46:02 AM] Rox SOUTH: feel free to declare over Rachel Koh too~ if u haven’t and u wanna!
[11/3/20, 11:04:44 AM] Rox SOUTH: 🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞
Also good morning pals!! Just wanted to share something that’s been on Ps Dan’s heart that he shared with the Overseers and it really ministered to me :”) and I pray it ministers to you too~

One of the things on Ps Dan’s heart (since the beginning of the year) is 🌟🌈The early church.

“42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. 43 Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 44 Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, 45 and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.
46 So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.”
Acts 2:42-47 NKJV

We are coming back to do the things that the early church did! And we will see the same results. The 4 things that God gave the early church were one by one stolen by the enemy. 
 ⁃ Holy Communion: We are not using it as a symbol, this is not transubstantiation. We discern the body and the blood today.
 ⁃ Praying in the Spirit: Only came back in the 1900s. Asuza street revival.
 ⁃ And the rest were brought back.

The enemy saw that there was genuine love in the hearts in the early church for one another! They sold their possessions for one another! There was a lot of favour. If we look at the following scriptures, God began to move! God gave the spirit, God added 3000, God added to the church daily!

The Lord spoke to Ps Dan about these 4 things that All these 4 things are to be received!!! 
 ⁃ Holy comm is to be received. Doctrine is to be received. Friendship is received. Prayer is also to be received — not so much for us to do, but for the Lord to give to us. And when we receive, we will get a great great harvest.

Let us not neglect this daily receiving of the blessings that God has given the early church. It’s not a focus on growth. It’s a focus on the Lord! Let us focus on being together in one accord, and hence,  being blessed. ⚡️🌈🌟🌝🥳

as you prep for CG, may His love fill your days and your nights ❤️ let me know once it is up too~ so i can consecrate it in prayer and give y’all feedback 🥰
[11/3/20, 11:06:59 AM] Erisa ARROW SA: Hey Rach Koh! I declare that you will be so aware of the little things in your life that remind you of Jesus and that instead of worry and fear, the Lord gives you His peace and an abundance of joy! amen!

He has planted eternity in the human heart, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God’s work from beginning to end.” (NLT). Declaring that the Lord will take you through all the desires of your heart one step at a time and that you shall see success after success at the right  place and at the right time. Speaking forth a fresh outpouring of Jesus’ love on you, that in the midst of the hustle and bustle of life, you will always be wrapped within His love for you and there you are secure ☺️🌈 amen!
[11/3/20, 11:21:06 PM] Rox SOUTH: Amen!!! 🔥❤️

[11/3/20, 11:33:21 PM] Rox SOUTH: Rae Lee!!! Saw Psalm 27:13-14 for you “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.”

In the waiting (qavah), He is binding you up with Him, showing you a fresh portion of the intimate adventure of life you are on with Him :) though things may seem murky and uncertain, one truth remains, is that He is madly in love with you. And as you remain and abide in Him, He shall show you a new way, a fresh way, of seeing, of doing, of abiding! He is shifting your Paradigm, your start point, and your end point, and everything in between, to show more of His beauty, His grace, and His glory. for the things you have found difficulty believing His goodness in this side of heaven, the Lord shall show you anew what Heaven on Earth looks like. He is building in you storehouses of gold, silver, and precious gems!!! And just as much as you think you desire to gaze at His beauty, the Lord desires to gaze at you, His precious one.  Declaring a life such that if there were no signs and wonders, it would be a surprise! and His rivers of living waters supplies you, sustains you, and brings you to a broad place of abundance- one that is secure in who He says you are, and a place u have not gone before 🌟💪🌈⚡️💫

```Receiving Agent: Joelle Lai```

_Let’s all pray over Joelle today!_
[12/3/20, 1:23:56 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Joelle’s surname is Lai??
[12/3/20, 1:24:05 PM] Loocurse ARROW: How did I never know that @6598689095
[12/3/20, 1:24:50 PM] Rox SOUTH: Eh did I get it wrong haha
[12/3/20, 1:25:42 PM] Megan ARROW: Ahaha Rox you’re correct :”)
[12/3/20, 1:28:07 PM] Joelle ARROW CJ: HAHA yes
[13/3/20, 12:02:09 AM] Rox SOUTH: Yo Joelle!!! Saw 2 Cor 3:2-3 for you!! “2 You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men; 3 clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart.” 

Just felt like in this season of stepping up, the Lord wants to remind you that you are called because He wants to call you to Him. Your life is a lettered testimony of His goodness and grace. You don’t have to focus on what to do, what to write on the people’s hearts- because focusing on the demands is bondage. God wants you to go to the person of JESUS, because in Him is life! Let Him bring out the enjoyment of a life of worship unto the Lord. He desires to give you unbridled joy in all your spheres and your relationships, and He strengthens your frame!! Even as He springs questions in your heart, you shall live more and more in the knowing that grace is not a subject, but it is an encounter with the Way, then Truth, and the Life. You are here not to build the ministry but for the Lord to build you. Declaring that you shall abide in such a freshness that JESUS is central, and everything else is secondary, everything else is by-product! He keeps you in His love, and He guides you in His counsel 🌈🙌💫
[13/3/20, 1:37:09 AM] Vanessa: Amen!!!
[13/3/20, 1:46:45 AM] Vanessa: Hi joelle. Just saw Colossians 1:17  “And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.” for you and wanna declare that as you abide in Jesus, everything falls into place. Speaking forth peace, clarity and ease into your life and circumstances - you can just relax and trust the Lord, we walk by faith and not by sight 🙌🏻 You are loved by the King, and just declaring that you shall experience that love at every waking and sleeping moment 🌈
[13/3/20, 8:27:42 AM] Rox SOUTH: Bump on this!!!

_Let’s all pray over Nay today!_
[13/3/20, 12:01:47 PM] Rox SOUTH: anyway guys!! Don’t feel condemned if you haven’t prayed for everyone okay!! I know y’all are with me in the Spirit hehe ❤️ appreciate y’all, know it’s not the easiest to keep up with so many messages :) it was meant to be a voluntary thing, but feel free to drop a prayer to anyone you feel led too :) because really, the best thing we can do for one another is to pray for another, and know that the Lord is in the midst of us holding us and all things together :) He is the bond of Peace!!! 🌈⚡️ 

Just wanted to share with you all something that blessed me as we enter a crazy weekend (crazy as in take more ground for JESUS kinda crazy), which is this little snippet from JUDAH Smith https://www.instagram.com/p/B9kguPzp9lw/?igshid=10v1cwsj2g9dm

JESUS has changed the tone of everything in our lives, and I pray we live from this consciousness and reality today! ☄️💥🔥

i think SA side has one (but idk if all of them are in it, i didn’t ask for details)!! one of my boys created a group in Jan to support & pray for the incoming NS batch :,) can really see how it has brought them closer as the NS community in SACG
[13/3/20, 2:38:17 PM] Rox SOUTH: Mmmm Noice!!!! I love that
[13/3/20, 2:38:36 PM] Rox SOUTH: Is it okay if we create one today? I think it’s a little easier and everyone who is going can coordinate
[13/3/20, 2:39:04 PM] Rox SOUTH: So is it alright if I add u all to a group so y’all can help me add the NS men in
[13/3/20, 2:40:20 PM] Rox SOUTH: And then I’ll remove the female leaders later unless u all wanna remain in it haha 😅😅😅 just for some brotherhood / not to spam us
[13/3/20, 2:43:10 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: then it’ll just be bERWIN HAHAHHAHAHA but sure!!!
[13/3/20, 2:43:56 PM] Rox SOUTH: Let me know your thoughts! Or u can pm me too :) can discuss in the CJ /SA groups but I think why a combined group is good Cos NS is a shared experience, and the boys across vocations and ranks can look out for one another :)

[13/3/20, 11:16:49 PM] Rox SOUTH: *TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF SERVICES - JOIN US ONLINE*

Dear Zone Leaders,

In light of the recent national address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and advisories issued by the authorities, the leadership of the church has decided to *temporarily suspend all our services* (English, Chinese, youth and children’s classes) for three weeks starting from this Sunday, 15 March 2020 to Saturday, 4 April 2020.

We are continuing to engage with the authorities to seek clarifications regarding the necessary precautions to be implemented for the safety and well-being of all of our members.

*Care group meetings will carry on as per normal for Arrow, Varsity and GenRev, unless advised otherwise.* 🤗 

*Online Services*
We invite you and your loved ones to join us online at www.newcreation.org.sg for our English and Mandarin services, and Rock Kidz children's lessons, to worship the Lord and receive from the Word during this time.

Here are more details on our online services and classes:

*English services* | 11.30am and 2.30pm

*Rock Kidz children lessons* |On demand from 8.30am

*Mandarin sermon* |On demand from 8.30am

Let’s continue to stand together in faith and pray Psalm 91 over ourselves, our families and our nation. We will see you online this Sunday and look forward to assembling together as church once again very soon!

For the latest updates, please visit www.newcreation.org.sg·
[13/3/20, 11:16:50 PM] Rox SOUTH: Do note that you may send this to your youths/their parents for them to refer to 😊

[16/3/20, 2:20:57 PM] Rox SOUTH: Just a lil update for this week :)

The Arrow FT team are still confirming the plan. It’s hol week this week for our youths so it’s cool to prepare to do something casual w the youths but what Arrow is trying to do is actually record a short sharing for the youths that might provide discussion points for them after (without the ldrs (y’all) having to prep a cgm). 
🥳🤩Hence, do standby for service timing kind of engagement (without additional post-Svc since it would be a lot shorter than an actual service) 😊 

thank you for ur patience and for hanging on a bit more!!
[16/3/20, 2:23:53 PM] Rox SOUTH: Let’s keep the Arrow FT team in prayer this week~ and thank u for moving with the changes friends :”) I know it’s tough with it being busy school season, but I know the lord is increasing us in grace, step by step, and we shall see so much harvest rest and joy!! Because what the enemy meant for evil, He always turns it for our good :)
[16/3/20, 2:24:15 PM] Rox SOUTH: Also if anyone has CG pics from saturday, please send me!! we wanna share them on the tele channel!! pics
[16/3/20, 4:13:16 PM] Berwin ARROW: will do the same hehe
[16/3/20, 9:49:09 PM] Berwin ARROW: meaning we'll still plan to meet in person w our cgs?
[16/3/20, 10:13:33 PM] Rox SOUTH: Yup likely!!!
[17/3/20, 8:14:03 AM] Rox SOUTH: hello!! I lost my WhatsApp chat history and I didn’t  back it up :”) so if I haven’t replied u on something can u retext me!!
[17/3/20, 8:14:07 AM] Rox SOUTH: Thank u!!
[17/3/20, 11:12:18 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey Arrow Leaders! 🤩 Thanks for hanging in there with us~ 

We would like to confirm that there will be *no youth services* happening and we will also not be having caregroup in place of that *for this week*. Instead, you can get your youths excited for *special content* that we’re working towards dropping during caregroup next weekend! Please PM us if u have any questions 🤓
[17/3/20, 11:12:49 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey guys!! so the revised update is no cg!!! Thanks for running w us ❤️
[17/3/20, 11:13:06 PM] Rox SOUTH: Can Comms to the CGs!!
[17/3/20, 11:34:48 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: okie noted! thanks rox
[17/3/20, 11:45:14 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: ooo okie :)
[17/3/20, 11:45:56 PM] Vanessa: Okie rox!
[17/3/20, 11:47:11 PM] Rox SOUTH: Regarding any questions about still having cg;

The no cg rule is not implemented hard and fast but be wise about the duration and it has to be clearly communicated that it is optional (best if it’s not initiated by the leaders) because we have communicated with parents previously that we’re focusing on core activities: Sunday Svc and caregroup. And while I know there’s a community building element to it, the optics are not the best for this type of activity at the moment as it may not seem essential:)
[17/3/20, 11:47:23 PM] Rox SOUTH: Thanks guys❤️🥰
[18/3/20, 8:56:05 AM] Rox SOUTH: This one don’t send out okay!!! Not official comms just fyi :)
[18/3/20, 9:18:30 AM] Rox SOUTH: I can’t delete it but assume it’s deleted hehe thanks :D Oops!!
[18/3/20, 6:43:29 PM] Rox SOUTH: Dear Arrow Leaders 🌟🌟

*FYI*, here’s some comms that was sent to V and GR who have official cgs this weekend (unlike us) :) *it would apply to us as well if* you/your cg/your cluster leaders had planned *your own gatherings* this weekend 😊 we’re adopting such measures because we wanna protect our spaces and our flock! 🐑🐑 Thank you for being awesome shepherds:) 

*—— COMMS TO V&GR ——*
In light of an upcoming engagement session with Singapore’s COVID-19 multi-ministry task force and local church leaders this week, we will temporarily suspend all care group / life group meetings for the week of 15 March (Sunday) - 21 March (Saturday). 

This will allow us to have sufficient time for the engagement session with the relevant authorities to take place and for us to determine whether additional precautionary measures are required for care groups to continue in a safe manner. 

However, we will be taking our care groups online this Friday. Watch this space for more info, and we'll see you in cyberspace! 👩🏻‍🚀🚀⏳🌔💫

Please PM us if you have any questions 😊

3.00pm - 3.45pm --> worship + short sharing + holy comm 

3.45pm - 4.30pm --> _optional_ bible study 


📌 we'll send a link for you guys to join closer to the date!! 

see youu on cyberspace hehehe 👨🏽‍🚀🌠
[19/3/20, 10:46:35 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: is this ok?
[19/3/20, 11:09:12 PM] Rox SOUTH: hellooo friends!! 🙌🏾 in light of this week's service  being cancelled, we gonna be moooooving online woohoo and gathering together as ❤️South ❤️🥳🥳🥳

see youu on cyberspace hehehe 👨🏽‍🚀🌠 As our God is God of time and space, it what seems like constricted and restricted times now and amidst the frustration and disappointments, know He is sovereign above all, there is an irreversible future and a hope with the Lord🥰🌈🥰
[19/3/20, 11:09:26 PM] Rox SOUTH: Thanks Nay ❤️
[19/3/20, 11:16:38 PM] Rox SOUTH: And thanks guys for being so on the ball and willing to talk this out despite the assignments (grace Grace Vans!!!) 🥰🌈🥰 

So here’s the plan; https://docs.google.com/document/d/12tiDTBeyrfdDQBZjNcCPo7TfAuizLw2zb8or5mzN2eo/edit?usp=sharing

It’ll be a short worship (with Joelle leading, thank you :”) ) and word, with Holy Comm led by Bebin and corporate anointing by Rachel Koh :) 

And then we will have an opt in bible study! :) 

I think the heart of why I want to “gather” is really to just remind them that amidst the cancellations and disappointments (be it with school games or camp), we can look at our natural circumstances with eyes of faith, and let Him reorient our perspective in this waiting season! 

And as a follow up, from Mon to Fri, we will be sending out messages of encouragement (verse, worship, sermon) together. (Some people were assigned for each day) and the heart behind it is to really press into the Lord and let our eyes be focused on the one thing needful in a season of much demands.

Ops wise; I’ll work out the Google meet trial :) 

Thanks for running with us guys ❤️ Super love you all and I’m excited to meet with y’all soon~
[19/3/20, 11:18:58 PM] Rox SOUTH: Y’all can send this out~ should we add an attendance to get a rough gauge of who’s coming hehe

[21/3/20, 9:10:22 PM] Rox SOUTH: HAI IM JUST GONNA COMPLETE THE PRAYER CHALLENGE HAHHA :”) many days late but thank you for taking this journey of spiritual unity with me :”) I believe that we will continue to keep one another in prayer as prayer changes things and is the best thing we can do for one another!! ☺️
[21/3/20, 9:28:31 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hey Nay :) just felt like the lord wanted to remind you that doing the same amount does not mean it will produce the same result, that He is bringing you on a journey of faith over feelings and a journey of increasing discernment to see what is formul and not rely on that but to depend on His Spirit, who teaches you all things, who fills you with the life of the Lord. And He is breaking every bondage with the things of the flesh and showing you how fun and what joy it is to not just shepherd His people but to be a consenting sheep first!!

As in John 10 says, “27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” 

You are a sheep that knows the loving words of your Father, who frames your world. That in this year, you shall experience hearing afresh, hearing and believing the things He has written on your heart, words that call out the abundance and beauty He sees in you, words that create worlds in the God-given dreams and light they carry for you, for your household and for your spheres. In Jesus name amen! ❤️☺️
[21/3/20, 9:41:49 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hi Lu!!!

Declaring great peace and great grace and great grace abounds to you as the demands of school increases, you shall see the Lord work things out for you in so many unexpected ways! 

Saw the verse Nehemiah 2:18 for you; Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, “Let us rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for this good work.

And felt like the Lord was reminding you again that amidst all the disrupted plans, His hand upon your life only deals best, good and great towards you. And he shall turn kingly favour on your side! and He shall also cause people to arise with you, as He builds you up in Spirit, in truth, in love, in grace, in word, in hope, in faith, in excellence that whatever u build on this side of heaven, carries the touch of the Lord :) He strengthens your heart and your frame and is renewing in you a peace that surpasses all understanding and a mind that is intertwined with His heart for you :”) in Jesus name amen!
[21/3/20, 9:45:22 PM] Rox SOUTH: Let’s support debs okay ❤️☺️❤️ #SGUNITED #JCUNITED :) *send an emoji on the JC leaders chat when you’ve prayed for your buddy!! *

Hello guys:)) Since we have no cg happening this weekend, I thought we could take some time to care for one another. 

I've tried my best to pair/three us up so that we can release a word over each other!! I believe that we shall be so spirit-led and used by the Lord as we boldly proclaim whatever the Lord has in mind for our friend~ #b2bcommunity #b3balsocan

[23/3/20, 2:37:20 PM] Rox SOUTH: 🥇💒 Door of Hope 💒🥇

Pastor talked about 'lechem' and how to feed on the Word is also to fight :") and how like God's economy- that all we need to do is to DWELL and to FEED in the green pastures of His Word (the promises of God) in a battle. In fact, we fight from the position of already partaking in the spoils of victory- the bigger the battle, the easier it is for our God. 😇 🥐 So, really wanna encourage you to spend time with the Lord in this season, and let Him overwrite every fear and frustration in your heart with His word. 

🏖Today's sermon excerpt is a short one!! 🏖: 🎇 "Don't Let the Enemy Steal This - Joseph Prince" (1:15) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkkHOXKfNks 

🎆🎆Beloved, the enemy's attacks cannot get to you when you know you're loved by God. As it writes in Romans 5:5; our hope that does not disappoint emerges from the consciousness of the perfect Love of God :) He is our living hope!! 

Shalom shalom! Praying that His peace overwhelms every inch of your heart, as He floods every room of your heart with His love. 🐣🐣🥰
[23/3/20, 2:58:42 PM] Vanessa: Amen rox!! 💪🏻🌈

[24/3/20, 11:05:46 AM] Rox SOUTH: HELLO CAREGROUP LEADERS! 

This weekend! We will prototype a new way to do Caregroup! We’re calling in *CAREGROUP 2.42* and this is how it’ll look like!

*PART 1: (Fellowship & Communion)*
1. Gather your Caregroup in Digital Space! (Set Online Caregroup Culture)
2. Q1: How is your week (fire up the comment section - not everything has to be verbal~)
3. Partake of the Holy Communion together (Get a server/youth to do it!)
4. Worship (1-2 songs)

*PART 2: (Apostle Doctrine)*
1. Right after that, get them to mute themselves and direct them over to the unlisted youtube link to hear the short caregroup message! (We’ll be talking about PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT)
We will also send you the video in advance so you can watch it first!:) 

*PART 3: (Fellowship & Prayer)*
1. Jump back into the Digital Space, and talk about it! (Leaders get ready to answer the question first)
  • Have you experienced an extended time of praying in the spirit before? 
  • What stops you from praying in the spirit? / Why did you stop? 
  • What do you know about praying in the spirit? (Acts 1-2 Early Church, Romans 8, Jude 1, Ezekiel 47, Pro 15:4...) 
(even if it’s online!) 
>>> Take the next 10-22 mins to PRAY TOGETHER, encourage them not to multitask for that time and play a worship track if it helps
  • Share how the experience was for them 
2. Never end off the session with praying for each other!

[24/3/20, 1:02:47 PM] Megan ARROW: Helluu beloveds!! ☺️ For today’s sharing, I wanna share this worship song with you that I’ve been listening to, especially in the past 2 weeks :”) 

Cody Carnes - Run to the Father
https://youtu.be/HTHS4W1bPj8

As you listen to the song, you’ll see that the song talks about salvation but what I take away from it when I listen to it every time is the simple message: That in anything and everything, I can run to Him! As I am, with all the emotions Im feeling, with all the things in my life that may not seem to be going my way, I can run to Him as I am 🥺 What a heavenly Father we have 🥰

I love the chorus of the song so much, theres a line that goes ‘Im done with the hiding, No reason to wait’. Times when I have so many things on my plate, sometimes I’ll be like ‘No Lord, I can handle it first, its okay’ BUT your heavenly Father just wants you to let it all go and theres no reason to wait to do that. Dont shy away from Him, fall into His arms and allow Him to take over immediately 🥺 In everything you’re feeling during this time, whether its school that feels like a drag, anxious about unis acceptances or NS/work is getting to you, let our first response in all of this be running to our heavenly Father 😍

“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭11:28‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

He loves you (yes, you!!) so much, and we can run to him again and again and again and again, no need to hide anything, because He’s going to pull you in close no matter what 🥺💖

[25/3/20, 10:37:02 AM] Rachel Koh: Hellu Southies 💨

Hope yall have been having a good week!! Anyways wanted to share w yall a verse from psalms 16:11 where it says

⚡️You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.⚡️

So ye here’s a reminder that the Lord has given each of you an overflowing portion of joy!! Whatever season you’re in be it a valley or mountain or just a normal average day the Lord has poured into you an unexplainable, supernatural joy that does not come from circumstances but by His unfailing word!! And declaring too that all that you set out to do, your thoughts and feelings shall be pleasurable and this week you shall experience for yourself a life more abundantly!! 🌏💥

And wanted to encourage you to spend some time with your Abba too because all the blessings in this verse comes when we dwell in His presence!! Like what Ps Prince preached last sunday - position before promises 🔥 yeps so let’s remember that our position is in Christ and all these things shall be added onto us!! 🌈

Whoops have a blessed midweek everyone! Love yall ✨💕
[25/3/20, 10:37:38 AM] Rox SOUTH: “Some further guidance on cg if it helps: think of it like a “Svc” followed by their post Svc fellowship facilitation :) 

soooo in a given service you may not know the full contents of what is preached but you can still facilitate a convo after more from the POV of helping the youths internalise and apply rather than supplementing to the sharing (unless they have stuff to supplement!) 😊 

hoping the suggested facil questions help too!:)”

From Debs!!

[26/3/20, 10:46:09 AM] Vanessa: Blessed Thursday Southies! Here’s a prayer for everyone today. You know, when Jesus died, He willingly gave up everything for us, so that we might be able to receive wholly from Him. As u read this, remember whose you are. Y’all can speak the prayer out, there is power in speaking! 🙌🏻

Thank you Jesus that your word is truth and alive. Thank you Jesus that we can come boldly to the throne of grace to ask freely of all things. Today, I speak life into every dry bone, into every area of lack and strife. Lord, that these bones shall live, that we shall be filled with your spirit. Thank you Lord that your life covers us, that we are kept safe in you. Pleading the blood of Jesus to cover everyone and our families from head to toe, that we are kept safe from every disease and danger. Thank you Lord that we are loved and set apart by you. We believe and receive this. Thank you Jesus. Amen! 

Have a wonderful day ahead people! You are loved 🌈
[26/3/20, 10:46:16 AM] Vanessa: Day 4 prayer!

[26/3/20, 1:40:36 PM] Rox SOUTH: Hi guys!! here’s a message from me to you ❤️🥰❤️ love y’all very much and know that y’all are in my prayers!!! 🥰🌟

There are many uncertain things ahead (in the worlds eyes) but one thing is certain... is that the Lord is in our midst :) 

I pray we shall not despise the small things but our hearts shall rest knowing He is in the midst of us. I pray we shall be like Joshua and Caleb, walking with a different spirit, seeing opportunity and hope in what seems like a land of giants. For what the enemy meant for Attack... He is using for the kingdom’s advancement.

Have a blessed time in school enjoying the learning 🥰❤️🇸🇬

Listen to this one, it’s 🔥

Prison Break 
25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose. 27 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. 28 But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!” 29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. 30 He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 31 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”

I pray that this week, amidst the many demands, the Lord shall enlarge our faith, to take and receive from His abundant provision :) that what feels like prison, the Lord is breaking so many chains! That we shall go out and lift His name high with our lives as testimonies and worship unto Him :) praying we will have much fun and much joy experiencing no one but Him kinda life :) and after the prison doors are open in this season... all shall come to know Christ. In Jesus name amen! 🌝⚡✨🌻🌲

[2/4/20, 12:08:48 AM] Berwin ARROW: or is it just exodus 12 haha
[2/4/20, 12:11:02 AM] Rox SOUTH: HELLO CAREGROUP LEADERS! 

This week is a service week so we're continuing with *CAREGROUP 2.42* and this is how it’ll look like! (in case any of yall are wondering where's Caregroup 1.0, the numbers are referring to Acts 2:42 😲) *We are covering Holy Communion & elements of the Passover in light of upcoming Good Friday* Do take time to talk to your youths about it as well and encourage them to invite their friends:) Over 100k people have been tuning in (and a lot of them have been local) to our Sunday svcs, people need to hear the Good News of Jesus Christ!!! Time for #unprecedentedrevival

Here's a suggested flow for this week~ 

*PART 1: (Fellowship)* - 20 min 
1. Gather your Caregroup in Digital Space! (Set Online Caregroup Culture, appreciate them for prioritising time with the people of God)
_PROTIP: Set up a welcome slide EJ leaders pls share_~
2. Q1: What's something you asked God for this week _esp during 5/10 22_ (fire up the comment section - not everything has to be verbal~)
3. Worship (1-2 songs)

*PART 2: (Apostle's Doctrine)* - 20 min  + 15 min (video) 
1. Read Exodus 12 together! Discuss what they caught. 
2. Right after that, get them to mute themselves and direct them over to the unlisted youtube link to hear the short caregroup message! (We’ll be focusing on HOLY COMMUNION)
_PROTIP: Use Zoom to screen it and watch party together! They can even comment "amen" as they receive (the video is not for circulation 😁)_
_
*PART 3: (Communion & Prayer)* - 30 min
1. Jump back into Digital Space, and talk about it! 
  • Survey: How often do you take Holy Comm in a week? (pls take note of the answers so we can consolidate)
  • What was one thing they caught? 
  • The Passover was the shadow of the Cross to come. The Holy Communion is a reminder of the Jesus's finished work at the cross today. 
  • Encourage them to partake as often as they can & remind one another 
>>> Take Holy Comm together 
>>> Pray together for 10 mins then check in on Tele!!! (type their declarations into the chat box while praying!) 

Some things to consider: 
- Take some extra care to connect with the freshies this week and get them online for CG!
- You don't have to do >2h (it can get a bit draggy online, but breaking out to discuss in smaller online groups helps! Usually when they have the chance to talk among themselves first, it's easier for them to share w the group after~) 
- Use the chatgroup!! More answers, less time (get some of them to elaborate 😊)

[2/4/20, 12:14:39 AM] Rox SOUTH: If you feel that you would like to go more in a fellowship direction here’s some suggested questions as we remember the cross this coming weekend!! :) instead of apostle doctrine!! 
1. What would my life look like if I didn’t have Jesus? 
2. What am I thankful to Jesus for for today?

[8/4/20, 9:53:53 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: *JC Online Leaders Huddle*
8 April 2020 

Anchor verse: *Psalm 78:72*

_“guided” —> nachah_
Skilfulness of Hands - SOH
	1.	Connecting with them
	2.	Caring for the Flock
	•	Being present in their lives
	•	In the form of messages/ hospital visits, 
	3.	Collaborating
	•	Involving them with the CG (Engaging youths to serve)

_”hands” —> kaph_
Closeness in SOH
	1.	Slide into DMs
	•	Show them what God is doing in their lives, unlike their friends!
	2.	Remember key dates
	•	Helps with keeping them in prayer
	3.	Let there be “Zoom”
	•	Utilise this platform
	•	Watch sermons, have meals

Are there ways to make a big CG feel small?
How to make CG feel fun?
—> Give them a portion in the caregroup
—> Sharing/ taking charge

Genesis 43:34
Benjamin got a special portion
—> “Five times” = anointing and giftings

*5 Changes of Garments //*
*He has more anointing to give*

Going back to the anchor verse
What set David apart?
He had a different perspective

1 Samuel 17:28
David’s brother despised the sheep
VS
1 Samuel 17:34
David calls the sheep “my father’s sheep”

*Relationship with the Shepherd //*
*Faithfulness with the Flock*

	⁃	- - - - -  - 

*Psalm 23*

The demand is on the good shepherd to hold the flock together

“Shepherd” 
= ra’ah
= rash-ayin-hei
= head-eye-grace
 —> to be a shepherd is to be conscious of and to see grace

“He makes me to lie down”
Lying down in abundance 
= reliance on the Lord
= humility
Proverbs 20:20 —> dwelling of the righteous

It is the week of the Passion (T.T)

“paths of righteousness” is rounded
Picture of a continual upward journey with the Lord (like winding stairs!)
—> The top is called tiqvah, “hope”!
—> Every time we return to the Lord, we are justified by Him 

“prepare a table”
= “arat” to join in battle
—> In a battle, our part is to join with the Lord in battle! because He is in our battle
—> All we have to do is to SIT at the table and partake of the Lord; do not be removed from your dwelling place! Sit! 

The Lord is not surprised by our circumstances; He has gone before!
Look at the bread before you

“You anoint my head with oil,
My cup runs over”
Psalm 116 —> the cup of SALVATION
= “revayah” abundance!!!! the Lord wants to bring us to an unprecedented abundant life

“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever”
—> His promises again!!!!
—> Look at “dwell”


Sheep are typically reared for the benefit of the Shepherd (for wool, for milk etc), but in our case, the Shepherd is here for the benefit of the sheep; we have nothing to give but our “yes” leh 😭

The Lord is my Shepherd; one who would lay down His life for His sheep.......
[8/4/20, 9:57:07 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: i couldnt find the person screening the slides for deb’s sharing on psalms 23 but HAHAHAH i wrote down what i saw from the chat!
[8/4/20, 10:23:34 PM] Rox SOUTH: Awwww thank u Rach!!  ❤️ appreciates u!
[8/4/20, 10:24:12 PM] Rox SOUTH: WHAT DID U GUYS CATCH HEHE AND what do u wanna hear more of also k ☺️☺️ while its still fresh!!!

[8/4/20, 10:32:32 PM] Vanessa: I was wondering how I could connect w my sheep w/o social media HAHHAA but!!! Was super blessed by what debs shared abt how sheep were usually reared for the benefit of the shepherd. But when Jesus died, he chose to become that sheep for the benefit of us all. Loved that! 😢🔥
[8/4/20, 10:38:08 PM] Megan ARROW: I really liked the bit at the start about finding the balance between being a leader and a friend, that is impt to not give up your authority as a leader to be a friend, but also not to neglect being a friend becus its not like being a leader is being high up or smth! Reminder for myself especially with some of my youths sharing a lot more about their lives with me recently, so stewarding that balance is impt!!
[8/4/20, 10:41:32 PM] Rox SOUTH: GOOD GOOD THANKS FOR UR FEEDBACK FRIENDS 😊
[8/4/20, 10:41:37 PM] Rox SOUTH: Pls keep it coming!!
[8/4/20, 10:43:09 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: will send out after the call with my CG!!!!! but so gOODDD love the word and the insights that were shared :,,,)
[8/4/20, 10:44:32 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: for me, i loved loved loved the part about David's perspective! about how he saw that it was his father's sheep whereas his brother said where have you left the few sheep, in a sense showing that he despised the sheep! and david had a sense of privelege and i love that when we see that they are our Father's sheep it makes all the difference!
[8/4/20, 10:48:13 PM] Berwin ARROW: amennnnnn :)
[8/4/20, 10:48:25 PM] Berwin ARROW: wew okie thanks rach!!

[8/4/20, 11:03:50 PM] Rox SOUTH: Okay but it rlly rllly helps us to serve y’all better so thank u 😊
[9/4/20, 12:45:31 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: i think the front part is missing some contENT HAHAHHAHA but megs shared a bit of it!!!! leader-relationship balance kek
[9/4/20, 12:47:56 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: i love how the session covered both practical handles (with biblical principles HAHHA) and the word!! 

and the part i loved was the part about “arat” meaning joining in battle :,) truly a lovely reminder about positioning myself at the table because it is my dwelling place, and all i have to do is to partake of the Lord! in Him i can face any enemy that comes sobbles

[12/4/20, 11:21:52 AM] Rox SOUTH: I love what Pastor Alvin shared on his Instagram... that we now have the benefit of hindsight!! What seemed like the darkest season for all of humanity, we now remember as the best thing that ever happened because He is ALIVE!! In the words of our Lord JESUS himself, “Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and [only then to] enter His glory?” (luke 24:26) 

We were the joy set before JESUS as he took every painful step towards the cross. And now!! The price has been paid!! The stone has rolled away!! Death has been overcomed!!! And we now live lives of the FREELY REDEEMED!!! Not amount of exclamation points !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! can encapsulate His love sweeter than all things :”)) have a blessed time with your fam broskis meditating on the Fathers love for u 🌟👍💥

[2/5/20, 10:55:32 PM] Rox SOUTH: Ni hao! Here’s a few updates on the plans for May Holiyays and some changes!

There are some administrative changes to the dates of Masterclasses/ CGs. These changes are to create a more integrated experience for the youths, and also to lighten the load on us as we build up momentum towards Legacy Reimagined :) 

Here's a *chronological* overview of the coming dates :) 
1⃣ *6 May* 2020 Huddle will be replaced by the Open Jio session (830-10pm) + look out for our JC leaders bible plan hehe 📖#WordLife#Thrivelife consequently, this will happen weekly: on 13, 20 May (same time) :tada:
2⃣ The M&W Meeting will be pushed back to 6 June (originally: 9 May) for now :+1:🏻 :sheep: Instead *9 May will become CG*. CGs are encouraged to just play, or to take some time to share testimonies or to just connect with one another.
3⃣ The Possessing our Possessions (Take your mountain) Masterclass is shifted to *16 May*  ⛰
4⃣ *23 May* 2020 will be normal CG (Following the Spirit CGM) :ocean: + Set "Camp" expectations together :) ** we will probably set aside some time as a cluster to meet as well! 
5⃣ Remember to be a sheep guys! :sheep::sheep::sheep:
In the meantime, let’s be prayed up and asking the Lord for the GMTM Spirit :) 
Thank you for running with us guys!! 🎊

Please reply with ⛰ when you’ve read! 🙂

[4/5/20, 9:50:04 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: Hi guys, just wanna share two testimonies of healing that came in this week :,,,) 

*Testimony 1*
One of my youths invited a friend to watch the Good Friday service but she wasn’t very keen on it. This friend happened to be having some heart condition. 

During the Good Fri service, Pastor Dan called out healing for heart problems :,) so right after the 2.30 service ended, my youth called her friend to pray for her over the phone. The friend was very moved by the prayer and felt a sense of warmth over her. Because of that, she even decided to tune in for the 5.30 service! 

Since that week she’s gone in for multiple tests. Today the results from all 3 tests came back, and she has been cleared of the heart problem!! There have also been no more pain symptoms since then!! Completely healed!!!! Thank you Jesus 😭🙌🏻

*Testimony 2* 
On monday, another of my youth’s sister woke up with blurry vision and she couldnt see. Since she has had a medical history of this happening before (like it’s a legit medical condition, and she nearly went full blind at 22), they rushed her to the a&e. The doctors recommended an immediate surgery for both eyes the very next day :,,) 

15 minutes before the op, my youth felt the led by the Holy Spirit to pray for the sister. The sister cried and felt a sense of warmth and calmness rush over her! 

In the end the surgery went well and she’s recovering well now too :)

Even so, am believing for the sister for full healing from this condition!!! And that it cannot return in the name of Jesus. 🙌🏻🔥
[4/5/20, 9:51:23 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: Believing that in this time of extended Circuit Breaker, the Lord is moving mightily in South!! Excited for more salvations and more healing Lord, more!! 😢🙌🏻
[4/5/20, 9:52:49 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Wowowow!!! Loving the powerful testimonies!!! And praise God for the boldness of our youths!!! What an awesome thing to see when I just picked up my phone thinking to clear some chats 😂😂 more to come!! 👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻
[4/5/20, 9:53:08 PM] Rox SOUTH: Wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 it is the move of God :”) truly nothing can stop His healing and grace to invade all the rooms :”)) so good Rach!!  Amen to more to come!!
[4/5/20, 10:00:55 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: HAHAHHAHAHA oooff it iz a good time to clear chats now.....
[4/5/20, 10:01:09 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: amen!!!!! whoooo 🔥🔥

[5/5/20, 4:29:59 PM] Berwin ARROW: HELLO ARROW FAM:) 

Here’s to another edition of closed door bible study for this week! We’ll be diving into Nehemiah TODAY at 5PM! We will be spending time for the next few days thinking about LEADERSHIP from this book:) 

The link will be the same:
https://meet.google.com/mfe-usng-nzw
[5/5/20, 8:19:56 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: Hi guys, gonna share my one thought from the leaders reading :) 

Pastor always says there iz significance in the names so that’s where i started :,) HAHAH i went to see what the names of the 12 spies in Numbers 13 meant. 

It’s a bit long so i will only talk about Caleb and Joshua, but if you look through the names, they seem to reveal the gospel :,)

_Caleb_ - dog 
_Hoshea_ - salvation, renamed _Joshua_ - *Jehovah is* salvation
The difference is in the Hebrew; God added two additional letters “yud” and “vav”, representing “hand” and “nail”

“Dog” reminded me of the woman in Matthew 15/ Mark 7, and how the gentiles are referred to as “puppies”

I know Caleb and Joshua represent the new generation. After studying it again this time, i feel like i see the new covenant here too :,)

By the death of Jesus (*His nail-pierced hands*), all have been bought back by the blood, redeemed and made righteous! Jews and *gentiles* alike now have *access to the promise land*! And this is the promise we get to walk in yeyyy what a God we have :,)
[5/5/20, 8:22:48 PM] ‪+65 8533 0067‬: hehe this is great!!!
[5/5/20, 8:22:55 PM] Berwin ARROW: Are we supposed to text our sharing Rox?
[5/5/20, 8:23:02 PM] Berwin ARROW: And amen!!
[5/5/20, 8:23:23 PM] Berwin ARROW: Cos on the SKS chat, you said Thursday night is it?
[5/5/20, 8:23:30 PM] Berwin ARROW: Am abit confused hahaa
[5/5/20, 8:24:29 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: @6596931493
[5/5/20, 8:24:51 PM] Berwin ARROW: How it works:

[5/5/20, 8:25:14 PM] Berwin ARROW: Ohh I think Rox means they share on text on Thursday!!
[5/5/20, 8:25:16 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: this is the appointment for the SKS youths, Rox sent one for us too
[5/5/20, 8:25:19 PM] Berwin ARROW: Yes got it!!!
[5/5/20, 8:25:38 PM] Vanessa: Love this Rach!! So good 🔥 amen!!
[5/5/20, 8:26:30 PM] Berwin ARROW: Good stuff rach 🔥🔥🔥
[5/5/20, 8:35:07 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: A side nugget!!!

In Joshua 14, Caleb asks to possess Mt. Hebron, which he ended up inheriting :,) “Hebron” means to unite or bind together (like a marriage covenant)/ fellowship :,) 

So when Caleb inherited Mt Hebron, iz like saying the gentiles inherited fellowship. Our inheritance is a covenant with God (or more of God’s covenant with us HAHHA) :,)
[5/5/20, 9:22:10 PM] Rox SOUTH: Love this Rach!! So good haha
[5/5/20, 9:22:36 PM] Rox SOUTH: I learnt something new... I didn’t know Caleb meant dog or gentiles were referred to as puppies HHAHAHA
[5/5/20, 9:22:55 PM] Rox SOUTH: This beautiful too :”) what a joy!!!
[5/5/20, 9:24:12 PM] ‪+65 8533 0067‬: Actually the jews called gentiles in general dogs (as a derogatory term) ahha but Jesus was being kind to the saraphonecian woman :)
[5/5/20, 9:24:34 PM] Rox SOUTH: Oh LOL,,, interesting!!!!
[5/5/20, 9:24:51 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: oooff and i just learnt this too HAHAHAHHAHA thanks for the clarification darren 😂

[6/5/20, 12:30:32 PM] Rachel Koh: Sflr but yo rach yasia this some good stuff
[6/5/20, 2:30:45 PM] Megan ARROW: Hi hi so sorry I was really busy ystd and completely forgot about this until late last night when I finally checked my texts :") So sending mine today!! (Is a very short thought!!)

In v27 when the spies were coming back from the land they said 'We went to the land where *you* sent us', they didn't see it as the Lord sending them but probably saw it as instructions from man to do so, hence the perspective they gave about the land was more in the natural sense.

*Perspective changes things!* Looking at things in the natural and viewing it from man's perspective can often lead to fear and in this case they ended up in the wilderness for 40 years and the other 10 spies died also. But when we view things from the Lord's perspective, fear has no hold on you and also gives you an expectant heart with faith for whats to come!
[6/5/20, 2:31:25 PM] Megan ARROW: And i just read this too haha is so good!! Thanks Rach for sharing :")
[6/5/20, 2:43:16 PM] Vanessa: Ya amen megs! The God perspective yasss

[8/5/20, 1:16:46 AM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: hi guys!! ( _i know its not my week to share but i found something when i went back to read my old sermon notes from when possessing your possessions was the theme of the year and it kinda related to numbers_) 

in numbers 14 when caleb & joshua were speaking and said if the Lord delights in us.... the word delight _[chaphets]_ is also the same word is isaiah 53:10 where it says it _pleased_ the Lord to bruise Him

and i love love how in numbers when the Lord _delighted_ in them, He brought them out to a land flowing with milk and honey and again it _pleased_ the Lord when jesus was bruised for us!! and i just thought that parallel was pretty cool & wanted to share :,)
[8/5/20, 1:35:58 AM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: love this parallel, amen nay!!!! hehhe there’s no harm in sharing more :,,,,) so good eh
[8/5/20, 11:25:09 AM] Vanessa: Amen nay!!! Thanks for sharing :-))

[9/5/20, 9:49:00 AM] Rox SOUTH: Hi everyone!!! 
Here’s a list of admin for you all to cover with your CG later 

1. *Sign up for camp through the Brushfire link* :) barriers to entry are rlly Low and we really get the opportunity for so many more to receive and refresh :”) what they are paying for is rlly an investment into their spiritual lives, and I’m sure we all have experiences where when paying for STH, we value it more and are more intentional such as sermons!! The collaterals are also of so much more value and come heavily subsidised :) 

2. *Please flag up any discrepancies or difficulties signing up*- good if we can collate this!! @6590179358 can u do for SA and @6596730555 can u do for CJ? Thank u ❤️

3. Please also get everyone (regardless of whether or not they are going to LR) to fill in this *indication of interest for Masterclass * so it can help the planning team :) https://tinyurl.com/jcmasters2020 do it for yourselves too! There will be cg breakout after this Masterclass so they can consolidate what they’ve learnt. U gotta fill in too :)

4. *POP (16 May) is evangelistic* so get them to invite their friends!! Believing that the issues covered (family, studies, friendships, NS) will really be such an accurate word in this CB season to see and live differently  :) 

5. *Ask the Lord for LR2020 expectations for yourself and CG* :)) praying there will be a supernatural excitement and revival amongst us to let the Lord move on our hearts ❤️
[9/5/20, 9:52:05 AM] Rox SOUTH: Also please help me communcate to any of your youths that if they face difficulties paying (know it’s a tough time) and really want to go, they can talk to you :)) and then I’ll leave it to you to flag and discern if (1) they need the financial help, and (2) you think it’ll benefit them + they are willing to commit.

I’ll be happy to pay for *5 youths* for LR2020 :) u all can join me in sponsoring if y’all want too :) can just pm me how much!! 💓🥳
[9/5/20, 9:53:23 AM] Rox SOUTH: Have a blessed CG today :) declaring there shall be a touch of heaven! 🔥🙌what we get to do here is not natural and it shall lit a fire in both you and your youths hearts! Have fun ❤️🥳✊ give me a “GOD BLESS YOU”when read!🌈✨

[14/5/20, 9:01:36 PM] Vanessa: Hi everyone, it’s my turn to share what I caught from this week’s bible study on the book of Joshua! I’ll be sharing from Joshua 15:13&14. 

Context: Joshua had just given Hebron to Caleb & Caleb proceeded to drive out 3 groups of Anakites -- the descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman & Talmai, the sons of Anak. 

I found it really interesting that the bible would specifically name these 3 groups of Anaks so I decided to dig more. 

What I found is!!!! On surface level, these 3 names + “anak” seem q alright, really q mild/non-threatening. Off the bat, they seem q good also (ie my first thought was wow! They lowkey sound like traits of Christ): 

1. Sheshai - noble, mercy
2. Ahiman - my brother is a gift, brother of the right hand
3. Talmai: furrowed/plowman/abounding in furrows.
4. Anal: neck 

BUT on deeper study on the rootwords, these are the meanings:

1. Sheshai - to bleach, whiten. 
--Sounds almost like making clean right? Like how Jesus’ blood washes us clean. But when I thought abt it and asked the Lord, I decided to search the implications of using bleach to clean, and it is HORRIBLE for your skin. It is super toxic. It is really just eroding and not cleaning at all. 

2. Ahiman - of resemblance, half-brother ie same father, each to the other ie a reciprocal relationship. 
-- how I saw this was it bringing the law/ mix of law&grace into the picture. Firstly, if u did not know the truth of God, the law/rules/regulations etc really seem to “resemble” the nature of God because that is what religion is. Secondly, if 2 half brothers have the same father, then it means they have diff mothers (I saw these mothers as law & grace). And thirdly, reciprocal relationship really just screams of the “do good get good, do bad get beat” principle of the law. 

3. Talmai - Mark or be marked with lines or wrinkles caused by frowning, anxiety, or concentration. Which imo is a picture of self-works & effort. 

4. Anak - Strong’s definition of the root word is to choke, the root word etymology is “a necklace (as if strangling): chain”. 
-- speaks of bondage 

But Caleb drove these things out when he inherited Hebron ie when he was in association/fellowship w God!!!!! 

And that is our portion today too! That when you are in fellowship w God, when you know His delight and love towards you, you are 1. Made completely and wholly pure, 2. Completely under grace, 3. Redeemed from self-work/effort. You are free from bondage!!!

The Lord is so good!!!
[14/5/20, 9:31:32 PM] Rachel Lee ARROW SA: love this sO GOOD!!!! wahhh thanks for sharing vans :,,,)
[14/5/20, 9:44:50 PM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: amen amen!!! wow vansss this is so cool :-)

[15/5/20, 3:00:01 AM] Rox SOUTH: WOW VANS MINDBLOWING!!!
[15/5/20, 3:00:31 AM] Rox SOUTH: Rllly rlly love this revelation!!! :”)) it has greatly edified me :”)))
[15/5/20, 3:01:16 AM] Rox SOUTH: Also... haha ur mind is far above mine..
[15/5/20, 3:51:27 AM] Rox SOUTH: Mine’s a simple thought hehe!  (A few days overdue :”))
I went to search up the Hebrew of “wholly followed” since it was what defined Caleb!!

Followed - is achar; and the thing that surprised me was it’s first mention (and many other mentions) were genealogy-related. Specifically, the “after” of fathering. Blb also cross referenced to Genesis 22:13 about the ram that was behind Abraham that was stuck in the thicket (Debs also mentioned this) which eventually became the sacrifice instead of Isaac to the Lord. 

🤩 Thought 1a: Following the Lord comes by knowing your identity as son/daughter, of knowing your good, good Father’s heart towards you. 

🌟Thought 1b: Following the Lord may seem difficult because it may seem like it costs us much (45 years of wandering for Caleb, Abraham almost sacrificed his son) but I really love the ram which is a picture of grace and mercy, Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice... that for us, today, ‘forsaking all’ to follow the Lord then is not the sum of all our cost, but really that none can compare to the price of the cross. 

Wholly- is male; which is “to fill; as anything does to a vacant space with abundance” (blb)

🇸🇬 Thought 2: An all-consuming understanding of the Lord’s love (delight) produces a divine contentment- where all our need is satisfied in Him. Following the Lord produces a full, overflowing heart that leaves no space for lack to remain! 

Different (in Numbers 14:24 Different Spirit): is archer and also means a “following” spirit. It’s root word is also the same one as “followed” which talks about delay and waiting. 

🔥 Thought 3: A different spirit is a following spirit. A spirit that follows the Lord and the faithfulness of His word and promise. 
 
this “different” is mentioned in a number of verses... there’s Noah who while wating sends out a dove, there’s Jacob who serves Laban for 7 more years to be with Rachel... and interestingly though the root word (same as following) of this “different” is delay... the verses highlighted are about the Lord not delaying and His promises  coming to past in His appointed time (Hab 2:3) 

🌈Thought 4: a following spirit sees above the delay to see the loving nature of the Lord! That’s what encourages longevity in ministry, and perseverance  in our walk with the Lord: hope in a God who never disappoints.
[15/5/20, 10:08:12 AM] Naomi Shamitha ARROW SOUTH SA: oh wow!! amen!!! rox this is sooo thorough HAHAH absolutely love it thank you for sharing with us your thoughts!!
[15/5/20, 12:30:46 PM] Vanessa: YES ROX. Amen!!!! Love the in-depth explanation of everything, might seem simple, but vvvvvv powerful!!!! :”) Let us catch that spirit Lord!! 🙌🏻

[15/5/20, 4:57:34 PM] Joelle ARROW CJ: oh yes sorry!!! haha slipped my mind

but i think something that stood out for me was numbers 15:16
And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife"
I love how Caleb as a leader, not only did he have a spirit of boldness, but he also encouraged those under him to be equally as bold and just like what darren shared it was because he was so grounded in the promise of God (wholly following the Lord). And i think it sets a really good example of what kind of leadership we carry towards our youths. That its not just ask taking bold steps of faith but also encouraging our youths to be equally as bold and most importantly reminding them that boldness can only stem from knowing that the Lord is faithful to his promises.

And i also love how his daughter asked boldly "Give me a blessing, since you have given me land..." and how like a good leader's boldness (Caleb) rubs off his descendants and offspring, that as leaders when your youths see your boldness and your faith in the Lord because of his faithfulness, they would be inclined to imitate and carry that same spirit of boldness and faith:D
[15/5/20, 4:58:58 PM] Vanessa: So good joelle :””) amen to boldness both for ourselves and our youths!!!!
[15/5/20, 10:31:41 PM] Rox SOUTH: AMEN
[15/5/20, 10:32:53 PM] Rox SOUTH: THIS GREAT JOELLE :”) tbh this and Mose-Joshua always encourages me as a leader and rlly makes my lazy self happy HHAHAA knowing that all the lord wants us to do is to be in commune with Him, and our youths are imparted that spirit in like manner :”)
