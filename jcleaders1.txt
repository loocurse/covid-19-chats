Hey guys! This is the Q&A I was referring to, do take some time to fill it up so u can help us to help u! ☺
[19/10/17, 8:55:05 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: Hei leaders! 
As I’ll be collating the enlistment dates for those enlisting next year, can you help me to update the list of dates below after you received news from your youths. 

Enlistment dates (010118-300618):
Date / Type of enlistment / Location
4-9 Jan / PES A/B enhanced / Tekong
28 Jan / BP / Tekong


*a rough guide on the terms:
PES - physical employment standards (ranges from A to E)
Enhanced - 9 wks BMT
PTP - 17 wks BMT
BP - 19 wks BMT
Mono intake - enlistment dates don’t follow the main bulk of enlistees (do fill their dates down too, we won’t want to miss them out!)
HRI - PES E variant of BMT

If y’all still unsure do feel free to pm me! Thanks in adv!

[18/12/17, 12:44:38 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: Hei Leaders, as y’all may have known some of our JC guys are going to enlist in the first week of January (3-9 Jan). One really practical way we can our show support to these guys is to write cards to them which they will receive during their field camp period 💪💪💪

On the day of their enlistment, their parents will be receiving a letter from the army about this field camp mail activity. The parents will find out that have to send in their letters in the given government official envelopes 📩
 
Hence, it would be great if you could contact their parents on the day of enlistment informing them that the CG would like to be a part of this. Also, as the parents will have to mail the envelopes by a certain date, it would be ideal to have your cards prepared before contacting them.
Here’s a timeline that can be used as a guide :)
‎[18/12/17, 12:44:52 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: ‎image omitted
[18/12/17, 12:45:20 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: Points to note: 
Do try to seal the cards up in ziplock bag.
Do check with if your youth’s parents are aware that they’re going to church and are cool with it.
Card size should be smaller than A6.

Should y’all have any queries do feel free to PM me :)
[18/12/17, 12:45:36 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: Lastly, we will be sending out a list containing the names of the youths enlisting in the first week of Jan to your CRs soon! However the data is only based on those who completed the survey that was previously sent out!!! Do look out for any of your missing sheep alright hehe

[11/1/18, 1:49:22 PM] Berwin ARROW: Just wanted to share sth which the Lord dropped on my heart as I was preparing to do bible study w my youths.

Reading proverbs is not about trying to garner more wisdom, rather it’s about discovering the wisdom which we already have! That I will always rmb @⁨Abel Khoo⁩ once said that he always feels corrected when he reads proverbs and the bible says whom The Lord corrects, He loves. That as we read proverbs, we see how easily we fall short by the standards of a righteous man. That under the law we don’t deserve any of the blessings that come with it! 

But He became for us wisdom from God, then righteousness and sanctification and redemption. That when you read proverbs, see how loved you are :) that every blessing is truly yes and amen. That reading proverbs through the finished work of the cross, becomes His personal love story to u 💕
[11/1/18, 1:49:44 PM] Berwin ARROW: *#PROCHALLENGE* #day1

Proverbs 11:23a:  “The _desire_ of the righteous is only good,”

Hey leaders, today let’s lean into the desires and the dreams The Lord has placed on our hearts. Whether it’s for your ministry or personal lives.

Like debs was saying, that the word of the Lord is made to no effect because of our tradition. Let’s press into the Lord for a fresh revelation of everything that we do whether it’s HC at CG, or our personal time of worship w The Lord. 

If The Lord has given you a desire to say err bake cookies 🍪 see if He can do a new thing in your life/CG with it :) maybe your entire CG can bond and bless the rest of Arrow at svc with free cookies wew

Proverbs 12:25
Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, but a good word makes it glad.

Helloo guys :-) there’s a lot of things in our own lives which can make our hearts become heavy and fearful and even though words of encouragement and advice from our leaders/friends can be 💯 but i pray that our first response will always be to run to God, whose words and promises are the final say. And it is His good words which will eradicate our fears and replace it with gladness 😌

And lets be people who will also, after receiving His joy, be vessels for God and bring His good word to people who don’t know Him yet and bring them out of a depressed state into a state of supernatural joy!! Because out of the abundance of our hearts our mouths speak wew!!

[13/1/18, 10:46:50 AM] Loocurse ARROW: Day 3 prochallenge

Hi guys as we prepare for the first arrow service of year, let's come with expectant hearts for the word to take root!

The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, But the stomach of the wicked is in need.
Proverbs 13:25 NASB

The Bible says that the righteous (us) has enough to satisfy our appetite. Today the world longs for what we long for. When they drink the water from outside, they will thirst again, but when they drink the living water Jesus provides, they won't thirst again! 

Solomon, under the old covenant saw that we the righteous would have sufficient to satisfy us!! So today, whatever lack we are facing, know that in Jesus, we suffice 🙂
[13/1/18, 1:28:10 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Amen! Preach it
[13/1/18, 10:03:24 PM] Cherylene Choy: *PRO*CHALLENGE DAY🌳

The light of the righteous [within him--grows brighter and] rejoices, But the lamp of the wicked [is a temporary light and] goes out.
PROVERBS 13:9 AMP

Heyyyya! In this verse, it speaks of the *light* of the righteous, compared to the *lamp* of the wicked. It's an amazing reminder that we are bearers of the Light of the world✨, shining with the TRUE light (not a nooby smol lamp), one that is ever growing, and brings true joy!

It's really no point chasing the things of the world because they're temporal; but to pursue the things of God, to be beacons of light in where we are, now that's cool!!  😎

Hey guys, so I thought I'll share something that I caught this morning while reading the Proverbs of the day.

Where no oxen are, the trough is clean; but much increase comes by the strength of an ox
Proverbs 14:4 NKJV

In this short verse, I felt that the Lord really spoke to me to be restful and to simply rest in the works that he has done in my life.

The power and strength that comes from involving  and putting our trust in Jesus (the oxen) in our lives ( the fields) shall see us enjoying the fruits of labour and the much increase that we need through the finish work that the Lord has done for all of us on the cross.

So today, I just feel that the Lord is saying  to us to simply place all our cares upon him and rest knowing that he is a great and mighty God who will deliver our break throughs to us.
[14/1/18, 1:55:54 PM] Vanessa: Amen :)

Here’s what I caught for #PROCHALLENGE Day 4⃣:

*Proverbs‬ ‭14:10 NLT*
“Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can fully share its joy.”

Erm, ya it sounds like a v solemn verse.. but isn’t it true? We can hope our friends/fam understand 100% of what we’re feeling, you know there are times no one can fully understand what goes on in *your heart* ☹️ #HeartThings

But heyyy, man may not understand but God does ALL THE TIME! Whether you’re super happy or emotional atm, He sees it and understands. That’s super comforting to know that you’re not alone :””) 

Also, this is tied to *Proverbs 14:30 (NLT)*:
“A *peaceful heart* leads to a healthy body; jealousy is like cancer in the bones.”
‭
What are you meditating on? sooo ok you might be angry/bitter/envious cos smth that happened to you, but cheer up!! Let go and let the Lord take care of that issue for you. Easier said than done, but it’s not worth you getting cancer in your bones AYEEEE 😉 shalom shalom!! #livetheletgolife

[15/1/18, 8:22:43 AM] ‪+65 9298 2551‬: ✨ *#PROchallenge day 5* ✨
*Proverbs 15:3*
_*"The eyes if the Lord are everywhere, keeping watch on the wicked and the good."*_
Initially I thought this is like the Lord spying and if He spots the wicked He will punish them........ 

But!!  _Keeping watch_ here means to look out, to watch after. No, God doesn't spot the wicked to punish them, but instead He watches over them as sheep without a shepherd and has compassion for them, waiting for the day they would finally reach out to Him. Doesn't this show the heart of our God? 💓

The first mention of keeping watch is in *genesis 31:49*, and in summary, it's where this guy named *Leban* named a place *Mizpah*.

*Leban = military encampment in the wilderness*

*Mizpah = watchtower*

--> even in your lowest valleys, toughest moments (like in the wilderness or during war), the Lord will never leave nor forsake you, He is your Mizpah,  watchtower, *watching over you and keeping you safe* 🗼

_Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. -Proverbs 16:5_

First thing that came to my mind was: _"ohno have i been proud? does the Lord abhor me?"_ but the first that comes to God's mind is: _"Jesus their high priest is more humble that anyone; *I love them*"_

there is no thought or action that could tear you away from the relentless love of God because of our representative, Jesus', *FINISHED and PERFECT* work on the Cross!

#PROCHALLENGE DAY 7⃣
Proverbs 16: 20 *He who heeds the word wisely will find good, and whoever trusts in the Lord happy is he.*

Let's be conscious of the opportunities that we have to trust God, to involve Him, in the little and the great today - happy is he who trusts in the Lord. Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord. They will not be forsaken, they will not be moved. "Jesus, I put today into your hands! It shall be a happy, joyful day for me because I know You shall abundantly supply all my needs." 😊😊

*Proverbs 16:24*
Gracious speech is like clover honey— *good taste to the soul, quick energy for the body.* 🍯😌
sometimes it can be difficult to be kind to others, in & of ourselves (bc of what they've done, towards you especially) 😅
but we have a God who's ever so good to us regardless of all that we do & we can depend on Him to fill us with His love so we can encourage & build up the people around us 🙂💛 
it doesn't hurt / isn't of any loss to us anyway HAHA so if this is for you let's start asking the Lord to help fill us with His graciousness & reflect His great love to those around us 😀

Proverbs 17:22(KJV)

A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.

Pastor Prince preached on this before I believe! But, just to recap about what he taught, he said that having a joyfulness was important and he drew a parallel to say if one wasn't joyful, it would be easier to get all the different bone diseases like arthritis... Yup so it sound simple right? Just be joyful and your body and your soul prospers right? But, as I was studying this verse, I realised it had cross reference to Psalms 22:15.

Psalms 22:15(KJV)
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

This Psalm is part of the Messianic psalm written by David of Jesus's crucifixion. Jesus suffered a broken spirit as he was hanging on that cross. My revelation here is, because Jesus died of a broken spirit, you can therefore now rejoice!!! Because he has suffered a broken spirit, he has brought you joy and that joy for a merry heart that can doeth good like a medicine :)
My prayer today for everyone and myself is that, we be so conscious of the sufferings of Jesus on the cross, that we can't help but be thankful and joyful that such a perfect God would die for an imperfect man like me :) Amen

Proverbs 18:24
_A man who has friends must himself be friendly, But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother._

I found that this verse stood out to me becase im still learning to "friends" and it says here we just gotta be friendly. But when i searched for the root word in blb, it was like a paraphrase to evil. So like correct me if im wrong but its like trying to say, its not even be friendly, but just dont be "evil"!!! 

And then of course it continues by saying *but* there is another friend hahaha like even if u suck at being "not evil", there is that one friend that is cleaved(glued) to your side. And im glad thats Jesus :)

Proverbs 19:12 AMP🦁🌿
_The king’s wrath terrifies like the roaring of a lion, But his favour is as [refreshing and nourishing as] dew on the grass._

When I first read this verse I was like "wa why is the contrast so great -- the first line is filled with so much angst and fierce like a lion while it transitions to beinng very calm & gentle..."

then i realised this is just like our Daddy God!!! He is someone who can be both so fierce (at our enemies aka the devil 👹) but at the same time still that loving & gentle Father towards us His beloved children. Also as His children we are also under His favour which is like dew — refreshing and nourishing each day!!! #PROTECTIVEINSTINCT💯

Proverbs 20:10
_Diverse weights and diverse measures, They are both alike, an abomination to the LORD._

This verse really stuck in my head, and The Lord really put emphasis on it since it was repeated AGAIN in verse 23!

In the Hebrew the words "weights" and "scales" were repeated twice, so it is literally many weights and scales. And I realised that *we ourselves can find so many things to judge other people*. But the Lord then told me: "Son, why judge other people when I have shown you Grace instead of judgement?"

WOW that blew me away and I hope it sticks with you today to show Grace as God has so lavishly showered on us, even if the person does not seem to "deserve" it 🙌🙌🙌

[23/1/18, 3:43:22 PM] ‪+65 9222 6395‬: Hi JC Team, just wanna take the opportunity as we enter the tail end of Jan 2018 to say I am extremely proud of you guys and it has been an amazing journey seeing many of you being raised up to take your place in ministry, as leaders, pastoral servers as well as the various department leaders and all. 

I really think that you guys are the next generation and you will continue to raise the pillars of the next generation of Arrow youths whom are strong and spiritual. 

I want to let you guys know that I will be focusing a little more in DARE in 2018, as such, for Arrow, I will be playing more of a mentoring role behind the scenes. 

With that I will be taking my leave from all the Arrow chat groups, I know Arrow is in the great hands of Janan, Debs and all the amazing overseers. 

I will definitely be still around, “lurking in the background” to look out for you guys. 😎 

Do feel free to catch up for coffee or lunch! 🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂
[23/1/18, 4:17:24 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Pastor 😭😭😭 we know we're still secretly your favourite... can we invite u to preach for the next few services?? 😜😜

Thank u for going ahead of us and preparing the way while the youths are in DARE even before they reach Arrow!!! 😁😁😁
[23/1/18, 4:20:01 PM] Inez ARROW: nuuuu pastor!!!!! please stay herreeeeeee

Proverbs 26:22(AMP)
_The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels [to be greedily eaten];_
_They go down into the innermost chambers of the body [to be remembered and mused upon]_

Beloved, gossip is really contagious. This exact verse is word for word repeated in Prov. 18:8, meaning this is really important! :) Why choose to follow rumors when *you have His wisdom and discernment*. He is the only truth in the sea of lies and gossip :)💡💡
[26/1/18, 10:17:11 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: Hey friends, just felt impressed upon my heart to encourage y’all to pray for the speakers tmr at service! Ultimately when you pray, not only those it bless the speaker, but you too cause the Word shared impacts you too ☺

Hulloo restarting this cos i was rlly looking forward to this everyday🤓 (and also Darren paggro.... but i also choose to la okay) 

Proverbs 14:14 NKJV ☃
```The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways, but a good man will be satisfied from above.```

Its so cool cos the word “above” literally means ‘from above himself’! Soo at the end of the day, what dya wanna be filled with? The fruit of man, which rlly neither lasts nor satisfies? Or will you look above yourself to the favour of God?😊 

So lets lean in to all that God has for us:) for the world in all its richness is too small for our heart, but our Abba’s love is far too large—it is what truly satisfies☺😌

[15/2/18, 5:35:58 PM] ‪+65 9150 4597‬: Hello!!
So proverbs 15:1 and 15:18 are like parallel verses 
- How words can impact our situations -
Proverbs 15:1 (NIV)
A gentle answer turns away wrath,
    but a harsh word stirs up anger
Proverbs 15:18 (NIV)
A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict,
    but the one who is patient calms a quarrel.


And so are Proverbs 15:2 and 15:14:
- The wise speaks forth knowledge -
Proverbs 15:2 (NIV)
The tongue of the wise adorns knowledge,
    but the mouth of the fool gushes folly.
Proverbs 15:14 (NIV)
The discerning heart seeks knowledge,
    but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.

So what I caught is something very simple from these verses which is that as we are wise like the Lord, we speak forth wisdom which has the power to impact our situations! And most importantly, to *have a discerning heart* affects what u say and has the power to change ur situations! 

Likewise in Proverbs 18:21 where it says that 
"The tongue has the power of life and death,
    and those who love it will eat its fruit."

So ask the Lord for wisdom and a discerning heart to speak forth what u want to see in ur situations and watch them turn around for ur good!!! 🙌🏻

[16/2/18, 3:15:40 PM] ‪+65 9787 2846‬: “A man’s heart plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭16:9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

In view of the reslease of results being released next Friday, I thought this verse was the most apt!!!! Personally, I meditated on proverbs 16:9 before receiving my results and I love how it says the Lord directs our steps. 

Be it in Uni or in work, we tend to plan everything out - how we want to spend our time doing something, what mods we want to take, what course we aim to go etc etc. But I find reassurance in the whole idea that whether or not something goes according to our plan, that we can trust in His plans ☺☺☺

[17/2/18, 11:31:45 PM] Rachel Koh: Proverbs 17:22
A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.

Hello hello so smth rly simple i caught from this verse is that God is rly the only one who can heal and restore our physical health while all we have to do is to keep our eyes on Him. So Ps Prince preached abt this before - like how stress and other negative emotions can cause the development of physical sickness (esp heart related) yeah and tbh when I’m feeling super down abt smth, i would just want to lie on the floor and do nth cos i feel like my energy’s being drained from me. 

Yeah and the only answer to all that negative emotions is when we decide to bring our hearts into a place of rejoicing thru p&w/quiet time etc and as we declare the goodness of God in our lives and commit the emotions to Him, it can shift the state of our hearts into joyfulness and that is the medicine our body needs uh and yeps thats all :-) have a blessed time in service tmr wuhu

[18/2/18, 9:02:28 PM] Loocurse ARROW: Hey JC leaders, it's been a privilege to be nominated by @6597300351  to share today's prochallenge, but I wanna use this opportunity too to share smt the Lord has placed on my heart this CNY. 😝

My family has a lil of an income inequality because of their poverty last time, so while I'm relatively well to do, some of the cousins aren't. Not only that, they belong to less wholesome families than I do. When asking them, I realised it boils down to the decisions of the parents. Some of my uncles chose not to work when they were younger, joining gangs instead. Some just played around till their late 20s. 😢

Many times we subconsciously think, "Ayee it's my life, what I wanna do with it is my problem." We make choices thinking only of the consequences it brings on *us*. But later on in life, we are gonna be accountable to not only ourselves, but to people who matter - our partner, our children. Let's say I choose not to keep a healthy lifestyle today. It's true that I am the one suffering from high cholesterol, but my children are the ones with worrying thoughts and countless medical bills.

_Before disaster the heart of a man is haughty and *filled with self-importance*, But humility comes before honor._
_PROVERBS 18:12 AMP_

Today, the bad decisions we make snowballs into something larger a decade later. But thankfully, it works on the flip side as well.
If we choose to open our hearts to His love, we will reciprocate that love in our families. If we choose to forgive our parents for the bad childhood we have, we allow grace when building our own families. If we choose to be planted in the house of God, we will definitely flourish in His courts.

So today, let's choose JESUS! ❤❤
[18/2/18, 9:03:29 PM] Kai Jie ARROW: Amen !! #keepthatreal

[20/2/18, 12:41:45 AM] ‪+65 8389 7575‬: heyy sry this is my sharing for ytd's proverbs!!

Proverbs 19:22
"What is desired in a man is kindness (hesed).."

I really like what Pastor Mark shared on Sunday about how CNY is a time of family and celebration and how the colour red everywhere reminds him that every blessing that we receive is really really undeserved!

And because we celebrate CNY every year, and like what Lucas shared, it's easy to take things for granted and even take our family members for granted. Even though we say auspicious things to each other during the new year, other times we become easily agitated and impatient, and forget to show grace/hesed😖

But in this verse I'm reminded again of what hesed really means. If we are gracious and polite to our parents/family only when they are being nice to us, what grace is there? But even if we have that one relative that is always being mean to us, or your sibling keeps getting on your nerves, will we still forgive them & show grace? But that is what hesed is, that they least deserve it, we still give our best!

And that is why this hesed is precious and so desired in a person, because it is so beautiful and undeserving. And this hesed is not our own, but Jesus Himself!! And no matter how hard we try, it's so impossible to show grace to others if we haven't truly caught a revelation of it. So it is not our goodness, but His goodness! And now having received so so much, and knowing God has given us the big G, Grace Himself in the person of Jesus, we can show others the small g, grace, especially to our loved ones!!😜😜

‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭20:24‬ ‭NKJV 

Often at times at crossroads, I find myself unsure of what steps to take, or even unsure of my own desires. It’s all vague and uncertain as I try to think ahead into the unknown future. 

But we have a Friend who’s the constant in our lives and walks this journey called life with us :-) He knows us better than we do, and holds the future in His hands. He directs our paths according to His rhythms of grace, one step at a time 🤗

Just knowing this little fact dissolves all insecurities and uncertainties about my future, knowing I don’t have to rely on methods or formulas to direct my step, but rather a loving God ☺ 

We don’t have to understand all the time, but we know we can be still 🙌🏻

Proverbs 21:1
 The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord , Like the rivers of water; He turns it wherever He wishes. 

Even the hearts ❤ of men are in God’s hand, and not only their goings (Prov 20:24). And their hearts are not only under His eye but in His hands.👐🏻

Whatever relationship you are trusting the Lord for favour in know that God is the one that made man and kings (whose heart's may seem unseaechable) but He can change them, turn them from that which they seemed most intent upon, and incline them to that which they may seem averse to just for you! 🌊🌊

We are standing in faith with you and I know that our amazing God will answer exceedingly above and beyond what you can ask or think.

I am extremely proud of you and I know that your best days are right out in front of you! 😊👊🏻

[22/2/18, 8:37:07 PM] HFRyan ARROW: 22nd Feb Proverbs Challenge!

Proverbs 22.

Hey JC leaders. 

Y'know as leaders sometimes our youths may ask us really tough question? Or maybe even if they dont ask we fear that they may and we wouldn't be able to answer? 

I believe Solomon saw that his sons who would be future kings would face the same problems! And you can just hear Solomon saying to his sons:

Have I not *written* to you [long ago] *excellent things in counsels and knowledge*, To make you *know the certainty of the words of truth*, that you may *give a true answer to those who sent you*? [Luke 1:3, 4.]
Proverbs 22:20‭-‬21 AMPC

Solomon told his sons, have I already not *written* to you excellent things in counsel and knowledge leh. Thats like the book of Proverbs for us! So that we may be *certain* of the *words of truth* and I believe as we read proverbs we will be comes more and more certain of *the truth and truth that shall set free*!!! 

And Solomon says all this is to give a true answer to those who sent you! 

Wow, I truly believe as we take this journey to *read the proverbs together and daily, our spirit is storing up on Wisdom*, that when we are asked any kind of question at all, may the *Spirit of Wisdom take over and give the asker a true answer*(even if the answer is: I dont know, why not lets find out together)  :). And with that give glory to God when it happens.
[22/2/18, 8:47:00 PM] ‪+65 8268 1425‬: Amen! Storing up the wisdom here :)
[22/2/18, 8:48:03 PM] ‪+65 9800 5496‬: Amen!!
[22/2/18, 10:04:45 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Amennnn as I read ur sharing there was a though that dropped in my heart... so grateful that we have the Word in our lives!! Imagine if the bible wasn’t available! We are not without help, and we also have the holy spirit who is here to be a helper in our everyday! :)
[22/2/18, 11:33:58 PM] Berwin ARROW: What a man of a God this one ☝🏼

[16/6/18, 10:39:55 PM] ‪+65 8288 8922‬: Hi Leaders!! thanks everyone for being part of the whole JC combined item which would not have been possible without you rallying your youths! 😊 

There was such a tingling in the atmosphere that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand especially when we did the JC cheer.. Really sensed such a spirit of unity in this place and the part that really hit home was when we all shouted the line that said "JC is rising up". In that moment, it was like all of the JC youths were breaking out of their shells and labels to do everything that we know JC Cluster has never done! 😊

Shoutout to the team: @6582224900, @6583332620, @6597656239 and @6597872846 for running now with the plan! 🎉🎉

Special mention to @6597529151 for being our hulk of a cheerleader and a big shoutout to @6591083194 for being the MASTERMIND, coordinating the whole flow from start to end! 😊
[16/6/18, 10:41:09 PM] ‪+65 8288 8922‬: Also special shoutout to ACIB who made it possible for us to experience a major WIN for JC for the first time in 9 years of Legacy Camp history! 😊

Think for the most part JC has given up on winning in Legacy Camps but you guys made us dream again! Thanks everyone from ACIB! 🎉

[15/7/18, 10:17:14 AM] ‪+65 9819 4613‬: Hey mates!! Riding on the spirit of yesterday's #whatsyourstory shall we continue posting testimonies received here on the group, whether it is what your sheep experienced or what you've experienced from camp! Lets not ever deny ourselves the chance to proclaim the Lord's beauty and goodness, cus He's just so lovely right!! :')
[15/7/18, 10:42:58 AM] ‪+65 9819 4613‬: Mine was that during camp, I kinda sprained my elbow right. Then I was FORCED to stand by my lovely friends to get prayed for when pastor had a healing call. After the first prayer the pain got better, but my arm was still stiff. Then pastor said if the pain hasn't left, he would pray again. Then again he prayed and the stiffness loosened!! I was like wow prase the Lord all's good!

But no the stiffness came back a few hours later and I was like, "oh man I stood up and everyone saw I was healed..." but after that Everytime someone asked me about the healing, I would say the stiffness came back. I will then try to move my arm in the same way to show them my limited movement, but then I would realise the stiffness is much less compared to when I last spoke about it with the previous person and we will give thanks to the Lord together!!

So by the end of camp, my arm was fully healed!! The stiffness and pain was gone, and it's not come back since! So just wanna say Everytime u share the Lord hears, and every detail in what you say He pays attention to! Good or not, there's only one outcome with our Lord Jesus, and it's that He cannot help but draw near when you speak, especially when it's of Him. So let our response be a heart full of joy, delighting in our Lord Jesus out of an overflow :)
[15/7/18, 12:22:02 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: Wahhhh PTL!!! Amen 😭
[15/7/18, 12:25:34 PM] ‪+65 9800 5496‬: Here's my testimony!

It started when for some weird reason, I saw quite a few leaders who suddenly had knee pain on Day 1&2. And I was like would I get it? After Day 3 morning service, I suddenly had a sharp pain in my right knee, so much so that I could not stand up or bend down properly. Even kneeling was a challenge.

During a ministering session that night, I asked Mel (thank you!) to pray for me. She prayed at least 8 times but the pain was still there. The next morning, I just continued to do what I did during services and knelt down even though it was pain. Then the Lord reminded me that *His blood flows through my veins*. My mum believed that when she had a lump in her throat and was healed almost instantly. So I believed in it too! Then I thanked Him for being faithful.

The Lord then asked me to start declaring over people that His blood flows through their veins. I stood up and prayed for the people around me. As I knelt back down, I realised that I had no pain when I stood up and knelt back down! Really praise Jesus that He would have His precious blood flowing through us that our bodies and minds *cannot help but be strengthened and whole by His blood*
[17/7/18, 11:07:47 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: WOW praise the Lord for the awesome testimonies:)) keep it coming!

[1/6/19, 2:45:23 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hi Leaders! We’re still on the lookout for testimonies from youths/grads who have been blessed in their Arrow seasons. Please feel free to share your own stories as well 😊 

Some possible profiles of testimonies:
1. The J1 youth who found family in his Arrow CG despite previous negative secondary school experiences 
2. The j2 youth who was irregular in his first year in Arrow, felt as if Alevels was the end of the world/ dark season, yet found hope and a greater purpose when coming back to Arrow.
3. The NSF who never had a revelation of community, found family and a deeper walk with the Lord through Arrow.
4. The youth who never felt he would be accepted for whoever he was because of past hurts/circumstances, found a place unlike anything before. 

Just to be clear, you are NOT limited to these profiles of testimonies! We’re really just looking for stories of the Lord’s goodness in our lives. Basically to share their lives, of how God has been so faithful and good to us ☺

These testimonies would go a long way in planning an awesome service experience for our irregular youths, for a touch of Heaven that God has already divinely orchestrated for them. 

Thank you so much :-) for being such diligent shepherds. We appreciate everything that you do for the youths and this House. Especially nagging your youths to send you their testimonies 😩😛🤪

[6/6/19, 10:05:03 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hi everyone :) do send me the testimonies, be it from your youths or even yourselves.

Essentially as many stories as possible, of that touch of heaven as they experienced Jesus for themselves in arrow. 

CG might be a good opportunity to ask your youths like “when was the first time God was real in your life/ when was the last time you experienced His presence so strongly?”
Do send it to me by Sunday, 1pm latest!

Thanks guys :-)

[19/6/19, 9:26:30 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Thanks guys for being so on time and responsive! Here’s the mini-CGM, u can build each activity into a different meal time/cg sesh:) 

*How do you want to involve the word (God) in your daily life?*

“My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. *(Listen to the Word)*

Do not let them depart from your eyes;  *(Read the Word)*

Keep them in the midst of your heart; 
*(Meditate on the Word)*

For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭4:20-23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

*Activity 1:*
Form a spiritual habit of the word in your daily life

Before/After I (current habit), I will (spiritual habit) 

Eg. Before I brush my teeth, I will read Psalms 23 over myself.

*Activity 2*
 Pray in the spirit and ask the Lord for a book name, verse number or word. Then read the word and see how it resonates to you

*Activity 3*
Pair up with a friend, go into the word and trust the Lord to lead you to a word for your friend and share with them.

[20/6/19, 5:27:58 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: Hi JC Leaders! We’ll be doing the JC cheer as one JC after the end of ACIB’s item. Can I get your help to run through the cheer with your cluster during the cluster sessions? 😊

Garei, Ivan, Pierre and myself will be leading the cheer in front of the JC seating section later. Can we kindly get your help to get your youths to stand up to cheer? Thank you so much!!! :)))
[20/6/19, 5:48:30 PM] Tierney SOUTH CJ: Oh also, this will be the rough plan for later:

After the ACIB item, could I get ACIB to head back to the seating section, and the rest of the clusters to stand up and then Garei, Ivan, Pierre and myself will run over to the emcees, and we’ll start the cheer from there!

Oh and please scream loudly at the end of the cheer. *this is very important* Thanks guys!! ✋

[21/6/19, 5:43:24 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Thank you guys for leading your cgs!!!! Appreciate the guys who stepped up to lead in the JC cheer and bring everyone together~ 

I’ve already heard multiple stories of irregulars who care to camp deciding to stay planted and I don’t believe it’s just cuz of the word during camp but because of u guys and the cgs that y’all have loved on and built! And because u guys had a fervent love in your hearts to take a chance ☺

I think it’s not by coincidence that we’re gonna put our faith towards believing for our irregulars to return home come July 27 Svc! There’s gonna be a flood of His blessings and His sons and daughters returning home!! 🌪🌪🌊 

But for now, the Lord bless u guys w sweet sleep this weekend and assure your hearts that He will be the one to maintain and increase the work that He has done, not u!! 💪🏻💪🏻

Please help me to appreciate and love on your CRs, they are truly THE BEST!!!!!! 🙆🏻🙆🏻 and im grateful to be serving alongside every single one of them and u:) the Lord has given us the best team for the work He wants to do in JC in this season! 🔥
[21/6/19, 5:44:36 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Also... JC will be back to claim the Camp trophy next year 😏😏😏 u guys really blew me away w the performances and how y’all rallied the people and got such great ideas for such crazy, random objects!!

[21/7/19, 11:20:47 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hi leaders 🤠

Our Homecoming Service is less than a week away and we have a few suggestions & reminders! 

🗣- Have a conversation with your youths about the heart (why we are doing this!! Create a group chat with your core/regular youths if that helps!)

💻- Look at Noah to identify the irregulars and assign them to your regular youths to text them (sneak attac!) 

💌- Delegate youths to write letters (divide and conquer)

👦🏻👧🏻 - friends are welcome too even if they’re not irregulars! So feel free to invite friends~ 

Thank you for your spirit of excellence, we believe this is the start of a revival! ✨

This week's service is about _*Life Under the Sun*_☀! This phrase is used more than 20x in Ecclesiastes: so if you’re feeling sweaty, tired, chaota-ed and in need of some refuelling or fresh insight into a mundane, everyday life, you don't want to miss this week's service! 

This is for everyone who needs a fresh perspective & a touch from God. Come hear & experience for yourself what the Lord can do for you in this season you’re in!!

We have snacks 🍿 & a roving photo booth 📸 with free polaroids, so make sure to come early to catch these!!! 

📅: *Saturday, 27 July*
⏰: *doors open at 4.45pm*
⛪: *Shine Auditorium*

[25/7/19, 12:57:03 PM] Yanlin NORTH SERVE CLUSTER: Hey guys!! As announced last week during Arrow Service, we will be having our homecoming service on 27 July! 🥳🤩 By now, you know we have a letter-writing activity where we will present some of our friends with personalised notes during announcements. Since 27 July is approaching, here are some things you can do in the waiting:

*1. Prayer changes everything 🙏🏻:* Ask the Lord to give you the favour to invite a CG mate you haven't seen in a while!
*2. Put it into action 📲:* Pick up your phone & actually drop your CG mate a message! Be bold to do it! 
*3. Ask for wisdom 🗣✍🏻:* Ask the Lord for the right words to pen down in the letter you're writing. We believe that whatever you are going to write has the power to speak life into their situations.

Be expectant for this service, it is the start of a revival!!!

_*Far From Home*_

As we approach Saturday’s service, we have some testimonies of hope & grace we would like to share with you. 

Today, we have Tierney from South Cluster share how he saw the Lord come through for him in NS & made a way for him when it seem there was none. 

_*This is an invitation:*_
-
_*To come back to the Father’s House*_ 💛

_*JC Service, Saturday, 5pm*_
[25/7/19, 6:25:35 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hi leaders :) we have another testimony video/ svc invite for y’all to send out to your CGs! Please send them out by tonight 😛

Encourage y’all to reach out and contact every youth that you have in your noah database 🤠 The Lord himself who’s faithful to begin a good work in them will do it to the end 🙌🏼 believing that every prayer, every text and every letter sent out will be seeds planted on good ground! That the spirit will water their hearts and make it good ground for the words spoken forth through the text invitations!! And The Lord himself will bring the increase ⛈

[25/7/19, 10:45:09 PM] Rox SOUTH: WEWWWW LIT TESTIMONY!!! 🔥🔥🔥
[25/7/19, 11:08:36 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Just sense that the Lord is telling us to raise our expectations no matter what the natural looks like because*!!!*
“... God, [] gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did; who, *contrary to hope, in hope believed*...” 

And that the Holy Spirit Himself is labouring in the ministry of reconciliation, that more than what we have to do, the Lord is ministering His love and His Father heart to us personally even as ps Dan shared w us last night. Let us be among those who dared because among all we are His most beloved sons/daughters/shepherds 😉🙆🏻

[26/7/19, 5:06:28 PM] Yanlin NORTH SERVE CLUSTER: Hi leaders!!! Today we have a powerful testimony about the importance of God-given community. Do send this out to your cg chats & we hope you’re as excited as us for what God is going to do at Saturday’s service 🥳🥳🥳
[26/7/19, 5:06:57 PM] ‪+65 9369 6539‬: amen la sia
[27/7/19, 8:40:46 AM] Berwin ARROW: Morning ldrs! :-) gentle reminder to send the testimony and the message to your CG WhatsApp chats if you haven’t!!

Was reminded recently that even if just one irregular turns up for service today, that its worth it all. Because Jesus would go to the cross all over again, if it was for just one person. That just for the one 🐑 , He would do it all over again. 

So let’s raise our * God given* hopes and expectations! Even today, the Holy Spirit is still moving and divinely arranging circumstances for His people to be brought into His House. 

Shall we, 
- trust Him for that word to text an irregular (never too late! God will always work with the least)
- pray in the spirit!
- raise your God given hopes (not by power or might but by my spirit: declare grace grace over your CGS and clusters)

The odds are against us, but God is for us 🤠

[27/7/19, 11:43:51 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Helloooo beloved fam:)) tho we’re waiting for y’all to update the latest attendance, heard that there were *about 73 irregulars* who joined us today!! 🥳 what an awesome party God has helped us to throw! 

Aaaaand I just wanna say that esp w irregulars, I believe it takes time! And I know that the seeds sown over the course of the last two weeks by u and your youths will continue to bear fruits in the sessions to come!! Because they knew they were remembered this week, & our youths are conscious there are actually more people who are supposed to be part of our cgs!!! I pray that it will not be a one time thing (just as we’re trusting that those who came will be rooted) but that our youths will also catch the heart for those on the fringes. The next prophetic text or next invite could be the tipping point 😉 let us continue to be filled with His love that we may carry a fervent (outstretched) love ☺

Wanna especially shout out to @6592340475 @6596931493 @6597656239 and gang who came to help out and plan for this~ despite the many changes, etc y’all pulled off the very *first* homecoming service in the zone 💪🏻 what a can-do spirit of excellence y’all carried ☺ it wouldn’t have been possible without everyone sending their stories to the team too!!! 

AND one more thing to praise God for!! There was indeed a *salvation* at the end of the service. :’) she came forward and Berwin led her in the salvation prayer ☺☺ God is so so so good to us! And His grace shall maintain our lot and take us forward into what He has for us! 

If u have any other stories to share from today/ministering/zeta pls shout them out / encourage / appreciate one another ☺ this couldn’t have been possible without every single one of u 🙆🏻

God is so good ☺

We thank You for beginning a brand new work in each and every one of the IR's lives from the moment they made the decision to come tonight.

We believe that tonight, they have encountered You in worship and in Word. And because they have encountered You, they will never be the same again.

We look forward to Your grace and love to flow continuously in their lives - so much that they can't contain it! And we most definitely look forward to seeing ALL of them planted in Your House - so much that we can't contain all of us!

All this I pray, declare, and seal in the name of Jesus, Amen!

[27/10/19, 1:20:20 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Can’t help but feel like the Lord is speaking to us loud and clear and He has revealed love secrets to us as we embarked on this unknowingly with the whole church!!! I really loved the part where ps mark talked about praying in tongues making us so conscious of Jesus (not gonna spoil for those who haven’t go service yet) but as we continue in this fellowship with the Lord we are being filled and filled and filled with Him 😊

[3/11/19, 9:01:21 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hey shepherds, although yesterday was officially the last day of 22/22 just wanna encourage us to continue to pray in the spirit and be guided by the spirit because it will avail much not only in our personal lives but even in our ministry esp as the youths go through As/IB! That we will be timely and sharp in knowing the state and meeting their needs with the supply of His grace! ⛲

This coming sat, as we gather we will also look towards 2020 and see what the Lord is gonna do! Believing that even as we each pray, He shall write His plans and purposes on our hearts and make ministry so easy and light because we can see what the Father is doing, and do likewise (just like Jesus even!! Check out John 5: 19-20 🤓) so come expectant knowing that the Lord is imparting fresh sight to us all! 🌱
[3/11/19, 9:05:20 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: *IMPT MESSAGE* 
Also, could we all take some time *today* to send this out to all the A level/IB keeds? :) we could PM them for a more personal touch, including IRs who I believe would really feel the effects of our support rn!! 😊🙆🏻 appreciate each of u v v much:) *after u’ve sent to ur cg peeps, reply to this msg w a short declaration in this chat so we know they’ve gotten it (& this doesn’t get lost also)!!* 💌
______

Hey giant-slayers, as you start your papers tomorrow, I want you to know that we’re all praying and rooting for you guys! These giants shall be bread for you because the Lord is the one fighting your battles. In this year of the latter rain, you shall experience such harvests of joy, peace, hope even as you take your papers and be filled with the wisdom and understanding that comes from God because you have the mind of Christ! Most of all, your future is so so bright because Jesus is the one holding your future (not the A level cert). 😎 

Love, Ps Dan. 👊🏻

✨ We really wanna encourage y’all to ask for the Ends of the Earth, and take some time to pray over your youths 😆 paste it on your wall or set it as your wallpaper and know the Lord leaves no one behind ❤

✨2⃣ 10 mins of *praying in the Spirit* each day till 1,000 😊🥳 ++involve ur core!! As we pray in the spirit we both build up ourselves, the church, and the future!! 🙆🏻☺

✨3⃣ don’t throw away the *Post-It* just yet 😉 Keep it in your bible (or anywhere else haha) and let the Lord remind you about the vision — we write that we may run 😌 ⛹🏻‍♀

#OnwardstoEuphrates #notbymightorpower #ByHisSpirit 🤪 love y’all!

[19/11/19, 11:54:17 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hey Leaders:) This will be the seating arrangement for svc! Since we're a back2back community, we wanna have people *side2side* too~ Ps Dan was sharing that it would be great if we could huddle in close so that no one is left without people beside them esp when we talk to our neighbours!! 😁 It's an ops thing but also this is the pastoral heart behind it is that no one sits alone that we huddle up close so it'll be great if we can work together with the servers to fill up the sections:) 

Also, since Os are over, it'll be great if yall can take the opportunity to invite the IB/IP/DSA youths  this week and start including them in your CGs~ 🤼‍♀🤼‍♂

For those who are prepping for finals -- declaring that the Lord will multiply the time that u are revising and grant u guys such clarity as u prep! It shall be easy and light and u shall enjoy the process and the fellowship of the Spirit guiding u and teaching u all things as yall study! 🤓
[19/11/19, 3:58:30 PM] Berwin ARROW: amen :) thanks debs!!!

[24/11/19, 11:18:09 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hey guys:) just wanna appreciate y’all serving esp this past weekend w finals coming up 😉 

I don’t have finals but my life includes domestic chores after serving on Saturdays and today I was supposed to do an extra large load of laundry. I potated around 🥔 and by the time I remembered I’d knew if I squeezed it in I’d be late for Svc... I really considered it for awhile but decided to just leave the house w the slight sianness that I was losing time. After service was over it rained super heavily and continued to rain. I wouldn’t have been able to dry the items even if I had washed them and I felt the Lord remind me that I can’t lose w Him 😌

So this week as for those who are going into exams/another week of work just wanna say that u’ll never come in second when u put Jesus first:) so even as u go about ur week, stay at rest and enjoy His presence knowing that His grace abounds so freely towards u, u have the mind of Christ and the Holy Spirit is actively leading and guiding u as u prep and do what u gotta do! Praying for u guys!! Shall be the best end of a sem yet! 💪🏻💪🏻💯💯

🧓🏼 *Pearl’s Hill Care Home* 👵🏼
🗓 *7 Dec, Sat* 
⏰ *8.45-11am*

We’ll be carolling & distributing gifts to the beneficiaries at the home and spreading some holiday cheer especially at a time where they may feel more lonely so it’s a short session and an early morning but it’ll go a long way in sharing the love of Jesus with people who need it most ☺💖🎄

[17/12/19, 6:16:18 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hey leaders:) as you are aware *CAMP REGO 2020* processes have started! 

One really part of the process is identifying youths who need *financial assistance for camp*. If they don’t submit their forms *by the end of this week*, we won’t be able to consider them for financial aid.

*Please help make sure as many of our youths can go for camp as possible by:*
1) Doing a general check/shout out in the CG chat for them to PM you if they need the application form 
2) Check in on youths who you know have financial difficulties previously 

The forms & supporting documents should then be emailed/mailed directly to Broderick.sim@newcreation.org.sg 😊 thanks guys! ☀ 

The gracious admin maestro Broderick has extended the timeline as we noticed that the number of applicants is much lower than last year so please help us check in 🙌🏻
[17/12/19, 6:17:04 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Btw, please ensure that your cg’s attendance is uploaded on the excel sheet by tomorrow guys!!! 😬

Hey Arrow Giant Slayers! As you receive your 'A' Levels results tomorrow, I want you to know that the entire Arrow is behind you, cheering and rooting for you. I know that our amazing God will answer exceedingly above and beyond what you can ask or think. Have an early night and go with the consciousness that your Heavenly Father loves you so dearly! 😊 I truly believe that as you bask in that love, you will even have the chance to be an extension of His love to your friends. I am extremely proud of you and I know that your best days are right out in front of you! 😊👊🏻

Love,
Pastor Daniel

“Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with *groanings* which cannot be uttered.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:26‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

Groanings - stegnamos: “not a known language” but used in classical Greek as “love secrets”.

Remember that as we pray today, it’s not about a todo list — the Lord is reminding us that we are so loved :)

Don’t stress over hitting your scheduled milestones in revision/project work etc. Maybe it’s about prepping for cg... but every time we lean on the Lord, He is supernaturally naturally guiding us and it will all be completed as we flow with the unforced rhythms of grace. This week, follow the life that is within!

*Day 4/22*
for if you are living according to the [impulses of the] flesh, you are going to die. But if [you are living] by the [power of the Holy] Spirit you are habitually putting to death the sinful deeds of the body, you will [really] live forever . For all who are allowing themselves to be led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
Romans 8:13‭-‬14 AMP

Let's be conscious that as we pray in the spirit and spend time w the Lord today that as we do so, we are putting to death the sinful flesh in our bodies thru just meditating on His spirit and goodness :') let us take our place and identity as sons of God as we pray today!

[27/2/20, 8:34:43 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Morningggless~ 

*Day 5/22*
“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭6:12‬ ‭

And in Corinthians it says that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. I love seeing God’s perspective on things because in the natural in a war we want to prepare to fight. *But when we are praying, the focus is not on the fight but the fellowship w the Lord*. And right there and then we are triumphing over all the powers of darkness in our fellowship with the Holy Spirit!

*Day 6/22*

But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, *keep yourselves in the love of God*, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude 1:20-21

As we pray in tongues today, let's be conscious of the Lord's unending love for us and as we pray, know that we are keeping ourselves under that unending love that opens doors of opportunity for us, setting us up for success wherever we go and a love that seeks no requirements 😊

Post a ❤ when you've prayed!!

*Day 7/22* 

that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of _wisdom and revelation_ in the knowledge of Him, the _eyes of your understanding being enlightened_; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians 1:17-18

Before our natural eyes catches up to comprehend what we see, we receive the spirit of wisdom and revelation; that is; we see what God sees through the Holy Spirit. We can do nothing of ourselves, but it is the Lord who enlightens us, to see and to do what He has first placed on our hearts! For what we see the Father do, we also do in like manner. 🤩☺

Have a blessed time at CG today, seeing as He sees!! 💫✨💥 it shall be well!!!

Blessed Son-day beloveds! 🌞did yall know, the Holy Spirit was given to the church on the church's birthday! 🎂🎁 Why? 

1 Corinthians‬ ‭14:18 MSG‬‬ "I’m grateful to God for the gift of praying in tongues that he gives us for praising him, which leads to *wonderful intimacies we enjoy with him.* I enter into this as much or more than any of you." 

As we pray in the Spirit today, lets be conscious that we are using the love gift He gave to us, leaning in close to His heart, and enjoying the wonderful intimacies that come with being in fellowship with Him!

“In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them. Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square, and said to them: “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy place.”
‭‭II Chronicles‬ ‭29:3-5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
“Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the *door of my lips*.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭141:3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

As we continue to pray in tounges, just like in 2 Chronicles 29, all the unclean things are being brought out of the temple! Though it didn’t happen instantaneously, the temple was still cleansed and the House of the Lord was still consecrated!

Believing the same for you, that as we continue to pray in tounges, all these problems that have been weighing you down shall all be cleansed out your body, the temple of God 🙌

[3/3/20, 11:04:42 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hey guys! Gentle reminder that we're still using this seating plan this month 😁🦦 We're gonna have an awesome word preached at service so get excited and encourage your youths to bring a friend who needs some encouragement! 🙇🏻‍♂🙇🏻‍♀ 

Also, what a powerful time of testimony-sharing we had last service~ We wanna keep celebrating what God is doing so if you (or you know a youth) with *TESTIMONY a.k.a. a story to share*, no matter how big or small, we'd love to hear it! Whenever, someone shares something, it would be great if we can get them to send it in to us in the link👇🏻 🚀 Believing that every person shall have at least one thing to celebrate at the end of this year and that as we keep sharing the good news, good news will keep being multiplied!! 🥳

At the same time, we also want to stand in faith with those who have not yet received their praise report -- if you/your youth has a *prayer request*, they can also send it in to us and we'd love to stand in faith together! 💪🏼😊

Today, I'm gg to let the word truly speak for itself and is my prayer for us all too!

[I always pray] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may grant you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation [that gives you a deep and personal and intimate insight] into the true knowledge of Him [for we know the Father through the Son]. And [I pray] that the eyes of your heart [the very center and core of your being] may be enlightened [flooded with light by the Holy Spirit], so that you will know and cherish the hope [the divine guarantee, the confident expectation] to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints (God’s people), and [so that you will begin to know] what the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of His [active, spiritual] power is in us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength which He produced in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion [whether angelic or human], and [far above] every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred], not only in this age and world but also in the one to come.
Ephesians 1:17‭-‬21 AMP

☀good morning everyone!!☀

today I wanted to remind all of us that we are Jesus’ beloved sheep!!

“The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice. They won’t follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don’t know his voice.””

‭‭John‬ ‭10:3-5‬ ‭NLT‬‬

I pray that today as we pray in the spirit, that we are so aware of the fact the Lord knows each of us by name and each of us are special to Him and that as we pray, we are more and more sensitive to His voice and what He says about us and where He is leading us, and because we know His voice, we can also discern what is not from Him and RUN from it. Amen!! 

Have a blessed day ahead fellow sheep!!

Once you’ve prayed for today send a 🐑!!

Yay friends we're more than halfway there!! 

“But you, *beloved*, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, *keep yourselves in the love of God*, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.”
‭‭Jude‬ ‭1:20-21‬ 

Beloved - your portion today is to *be loved*. As we pray in the spirit today that's what you're doing, to allow the Lord to love you. There might be 101 things to do at school/work/ministry, but simply *be* loved, not just to keep doing. 

_"Keep" = to attend to carefully / to guard_
And esp if you've been feeling like you don't feel the love of the Lord recently or overwhelmed, let's press in to pray together because it is He who takes cares of us so tenderly and most carefully for every need in our life & as we rest, He works to attend to what needs to be met :) 

When you're done praying today, send a 🥰!!!

I’m sure we are all familiar with psalms 23 but I really love this version of the verse as it says — there is no need to worry about the future bc we have *the One who HOLDS out future* together! He will even be the one pursing you and only goodness will come following behind 🤩

As we pray in the spirit today, you may not know it we are also prophesying into our future!! And our future is GREAT bc of the One who pursues us.

Give a 👋🏾 when you’ve prayed today!

_so deep much wow_

“Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.”
‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭47:5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

God is bringing us to rivers we cannot cross, beyond what we can accomplish with our own might 

to those who are overwhelmed/can't swim, know that these rivers are opportunities for Him to go deep and go wow with you :~) 

know that when we pray today it's like opening the floodgates of His blessings - and where His rivers flow, life flows

“Then the LORD said to me, “*Go again*, love a woman who is loved by a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of the LORD for the children of Israel, who look to other gods and love the raisin cakes of the pagans. ” So I bought her for *myself* for fifteen shekels of silver, and one and one-half homers of barley.”
‭‭Hosea‬ ‭3:1-2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

hello frens felt like today God just wants to remind us that we are loved beyond our wildest imagination 

So what if you've failed? So what if you've not lived up to expectations? So what if you've missed a day/many days of 22/22? I know I have, but our security doesn't lie in our own obedience. 

Every time you fail, God goes again, to remind you that you are loved and that you are worth every bit of His affection. So stop beating yourself up! He still loves you very much :')

As we pray today I declare a fresh impartation of His love into our lives and this love is what gives us confidence and security to walk out His promises

i decided to declare healing over my brother and wah his knee was instantly healed and he was saying that the injured knee felt more renewed than the normal knee and he started running up and down the stairs!!!!!!!  

so just tonight my mum told me her wrist was hurting and i prayed over her and it was also an instant healing!!
i just feel really loved by the Lord bc my family members are not from church, but the Lord still healed them!!!! PTL 🤪🤪🤟🏻🤟🏻

My youth sprained his calf muscles during training in the week and before service he was telling me about it and you can see that his calf is still reddish and bruising 😨 so during service our cg laid hands on him and prayed for him! After service he said the pain is ~30% gone and i said we’d pray for him again during dinner hahaha and as we were walking out of the audi, he was still checking if the pain is there and it was still kinda painful. But when we took the stairs down from the audi, he suddenly ran infront of me and said that he is completely healed!!!! Previously if he had to walk down the stairs, there would be pain but now he could literally JUMP down the stairs and he ran to share the good news with us so excitedly awwww :”) rly PTL JESUS IS GOOD!!!!

““Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:34‬ ‭MSG‬‬

gud morning pals !! just wanted to share this verse that really spoke to me this past week!! our Abba has promised us that He has already gone ahead of us to provide for every single one of our needs this week!! 

yknow sometimes (maybe just me) that when I do my 2222 my mind trails off to think about the impending deadline that I need to meet, the midterm I need to study for or the youth I need to text. But in Matthew it says to *GIVE WEIGHT TO WHAT GOD IS DOING NOW!!* That in your 2222, God has a portion for *YOU* specifically !! And His heart is for you to receive all these good stuffies for you this moment. 

And the future? It says that He will help you deal with *WHATEVER* hard things (that thing u think u can’t do well in, yep that too) when the demand for it comes!! 

As we pray today, just enjoy His presence and your time with your Abba !! I just declare that there shall be so many fresh revelations of His love for you today !! And you shall just walk today being so conscious of the supply for every single demand 🤩

"but God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while *we were still sinners*, Christ died for us." - romans 5:8

hi friends!! :----) as we take time to pray in the spirit today, just felt the Lord wanted us to know this, that when we were still in the thick of our sin, jesus still loved us. even when we did not want to know Him, ran away from Him, rebelled against Him, He still _chose_ to love us. He wasn't forced, He wasn't tricked, He _chose_ to go to the cross, to die a  gruesome death to show the vastness of His love. all for the slightest chance that one day we would receive this unconditional love ❤

i pray that as we go about our day today we get a glimpse of this GREAT, BIG LOVE ! that no matter how badly we fail, mess up, fall short the Lord *STILL* loves us bc His love for us was never dependent on our actions in the first place. It was always about the largeness of His heart, the greatness of His love & the faithfulness of Him to pursue us over and over again :,,,,)

Just a few things to take note:
1⃣ Remember to find a place that isn’t too noisy and has a decent wifi connection! Try testing it out so you know that once we start, you’re ready to glean and feed :)
2⃣ During the video call, please MUTE yourself when you’re not talking! This is so that we don’t hear from 80 leaders and their ambient background noises all at once! But also feel free to use the chat function if you have a question, or you want to contribute!
3⃣ Post-meeting: We miiight also look at some of the slido questions after the meeting if time and life allows AHHAH so feel free to hang around! Also remember to vote at https://app.sli.do/event/e2mt3bmn/live/questions -- we’ll cover one or two questions if possible :)

We’ll circulate a link later today! See y’all online soon :)

*Did you know* that Trees do not water themselves 😱 WOW pause and think of that! I feel like there might be a bunch of interesting people here who’re sort of planted in OG Jesus’ house, who measure people’s temperature etc. 

Maybe you need to forget about when you missed your quiet time or didn’t text back a youth. It says here you are planted in the OG gardener’s house, and please note here that we shall be fruitful, FAT and flourishing (side note: fresh is FAT is deshen, for accepted and ‘anoint’).

Jonah 4:2
“So he prayed to the Lord, and said, “Ah, Lord, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; *for I know that You are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm.*”

I love the story of Jonah ~because it features a whale~ because the whole reason Jonah didn’t want to go to Nineveh was because he _knew_ God was going to do His God-thing and be full of grace and mercy and be NICE to not-nice people. 10/10 agree with Jonah because God is really _too good_??? To people who don’t deserve it??? He would make a really bad businessman because really He doesn’t know when to cut His losses. In fact, He didn’t cut His losses at all; He sent His Son to die on the cross for us that we *might* believe 😭

As y’all pray today (whether you hit 22 or not) think about this: *this is your Heavenly Father*, that He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm. *We* don’t deserve it, but God still loves 😭😭😭

Psalm 36:5-6 MSG
God’s love is meteoric, his loyalty astronomic, His purpose titanic, his verdicts oceanic. Yet in his largeness nothing gets lost; Not a man, not a mouse, slips through the cracks.

Meditate on these truths: you are fully loved and accepted in the beloved. a BIG God loves small you! As you pray in the spirit today, know that the tiniest things don’t go unnoticed by our heavenly Father who loves us dearly. We are praying powerful prayers from our limited bodies! 

For those who have asked the Lord for healing (like me I always ask for 20/20 vision but am lowkey okay not seeing healing because can still survive w contacts and specs LOL), let your faith arise because we might just be speaking our breakthroughs/healings into existence! ((felt the Lord say also that He is restoring broken relationships))!

It’s Day 21/22 of praying in the spirit that we _get_ to do together woohoo!

Psalms‬ ‭20:7-8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the Lord our God. They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stand upright.

Remember *WHO* your trust is in beloveds!! Today we get to live in His shalom rest knowing that we are always held in the palm of His hand! The chariots and horses might seem mighty, but you have a God who is above and beyond all things and whose heart is for you. 

His shalom peace guards your heart and mind!! As you pray in the spirit, let it be a picture of the greater things to come and that you get to do this, that we get to have this intimacy with the Lord, because Jesus came down for us & to pursue us ♥️

Give a 🌍 when you’ve 22’ed for the day!

[15/3/20, 10:14:26 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: I love how we have a bigger (capital) *WHO* esp in this season hehe just wanna appreciate y’all for running w this the past 22 days and more than 22 mins for 22 days, I hope that u guys have found yourselves praying more than u had before whatever that level was previously — and I believe that more than a habit in itself, it will become part of a lifestyle of fellowship with our Lord where it gets more and more supernaturally natural ☺

Just wanna also say in light of what Ps Prince shared today about *sitting down* that truly *as we pray, we are being rested and refreshed!* 😌🌧 this week, the Lord shall lift u up every time u sit down next to Him! 🙌🏻

[16/3/20, 8:32:17 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Day 22/22 

James 5: 16 
Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be *healed*. The effective, *fervent* prayer of a righteous man *avails* much. 

As I asked the Lord for a short word to “end” 22/22 this round, this was the verse that rose up. 

And I never saw it this way but the prayer of tongues in fact if the very prayer of the righteous. Because if we aren’t righteous, the spirit cannot indwell us and we wouldn’t be able to pray in tongues. So as much as we can remind ourselves that we are righteous as we pray, it is also the prayer that avails much. 

And I believe that the Lord is encouraging us especially in this season of much uncertainty (school/ministry wise or in any other area) that hey, when we pray, it is availing much. And as we take one step at a time, keep praying because it has great effects. *We shall find ourselves supernaturally shepherding, we shall see ourselves doing and flowing in ways we never knew we could, we will see new favour, we will experience new WOW moments* (many newcomers, salvations at CG?). God’s plans are not side-tracked but He will keep going on and keep supplying and blessing and bringing us up higher so we can enjoy Him more and see more like Him!

_Encourage y’all search out the meanings and meditate on this verse!_ 🤓

Post a 🌪 and a declaration over us/our youths/etc after you’ve prayed (a v v effective prayer) today 😁
[16/3/20, 8:41:11 PM] Berwin ARROW: 🌪 amen!! Thanks for the powerful reminder debs. Declaring that this season, where the enemy is trying to force the church of Jesus Christ into a confined space, The Lord has gone before us: and brought us out into a wide open space 🏕 (in our ministries, our studies, and every area of our lives) that every where our feet touches, we shall possess! From Judea, to Samaria and to the ends of the earth. We are pushing back the gates of hell 😎
[16/3/20, 10:31:45 PM] ‪+65 8373 3357‬: 🌪  Dear Daddy God I just declare that especially during these turbulent times that you will give us rest, that we might be able ‘yashav’ and lean into your word and promises for us. I pray that everyone in this church shall feel shepherded and loved, that there will always be this secret place that we can run to you Lord in times of need. That every time we spend time with you, we will feel refreshed and safe in your arms 🤗  amen!!
[16/3/20, 10:52:26 PM] Reuben Chua JCMT: 🌪 Dear Abba Father, just wanna declare that you help us to take our eyes over whatever is happening around us and to guide them to you. As we fix our eyes on You and we take the next step on the spiral staircase, I pray that we will see ourselves rising higher and richer each day.
Lord i thank You for that the work You have called us to do is easy and light! Hearing from you to shepherd our sheep is easy and light cause they are on Your heart! Lord keep us expectant for the testimonies that are headed our way in this season cause I know that there are many more to come! In Jesus’ name amen!
[17/3/20, 8:15:29 AM] ‪+65 9144 8875‬: 🌪 Lord I thank you for every youth and leader and I just declare protection and Psalm 91 over them and their families!! That no matter what is happening in the world, for such a peace that surrounds them and cause your shalom to reign supreme in their lives🙌🏼🙌🏼😊 No weapon formed agaisnt us shall prosper and if y’all aren’t feeling well, I just curse every lie of the devil and for the lies to shrivel up and die in Jesus name AMENNNN💪🏼💪🏼
[17/3/20, 10:22:18 AM] ‪+65 9726 5121‬: amen! thank you Lord that You safeguard your beloveds, and You have the best for your people right now even in the midst of this virus. 🙏🏻 I pray that every believer will come to a revelation of how they are in Christ and nothing can harm them. 🤩 You turn this pandemic into a pivotal moment point in their lives, to turn them back to You Lord 🙏🏻 In Jesus name, amen!!
[20/3/20, 6:10:50 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hello guys:)) Since we have no cg happening this weekend, I thought we could take some time to care for one another. 

I've tried my best to pair/three us up so that we can release a word over each other!! I believe that we shall be so spirit-led and used by the Lord as we boldly proclaim whatever the Lord has in mind for our friend~ #b2bcommunity #b3balsocan 

(if i missed out anybody pls lemme know!!! my eyes are 🤩 trying to tag everyone hahaha) *once you have prayed and received a prayer u can emoji/sticker in the chat!!!* Thank u for being committed to one another's success and life!!!! 💪🏼😊

They probably haven’t had a peaceful night for a really long time, so just wanna pray that the Lord blesses their rest and keep them in the pink of health as they continue to serve our nation.

I just want to pray for everyone that is feeling stressed/ not feeling well!! I declare that pain and discomfort shall not have a hold on your body. It will try to attac but it will just slip off and every lying symptom, the Lord shall take it away!! 

And tho CG this week is going to be something new, I pray that the Lord’s calling over our lives shall stand tall and that he will hone our gifts to be such a blessing to our caregroups!! No virus will be able to stop us from gathering in His name and everyone shall receive a word in season ☺️

Praying protection and peace over everyone and have a blessed night 😴😌

[27/3/20, 2:50:08 PM] ‪+65 9823 6204‬: Hello leaders :) Jus wanna share w yall a testimony from ASRJ CG ☺️

So there's this girl from ASRJ who was invited for Arrow Services back in Jan by one of the youths in the CG. She joined us a few more times for service & CG, and when the COVID19 situation got more serious in Feb, she hasn't been joining us since then, until the recent CG session :)

After that CG session, i texted her the next day and asked her if she wanted to receive Christ, and she was like "what's that 😅?" and in my head i was thinking, i guess receiving Christ didn't really cross her mind then hahah so then i asked her if she wanted to be a child of God and she said "Yes!!😁" I Whatsapp called her and we said the salvation prayer together, and now she is a CHILD OF GOD wooohooooo 🙌🏼🙌🏼

It's kinda funny bcos for that CG we were sharing on the anointing oil & we were partaking of the holy comm, and some of the seniors also prepared anointing oil for the CG. But at that point of time she hasn't received Christ yet, and we can't possibly let not let her take the holy comm w us or not give her the anointing oil bottle cos that's just not very nice HAHAHA so i was abit conflicted and honestly i didn't expect any salvations to happen during CG. BUT the Lord is good and He is truly the Shepherd who chases after that 1 lost sheep, and He is always working & moving even when we don't expect/don't really believe ☺️☺️

Wanna declare over all the CG sessions that it shall be such a restful & anointed time! Speaking forth that there shall not only be so much joy in His presence, but that seeds of greatness & destiny shall be planted! ☄️ Also praying that there will be newcomers joining us at our CG sessions & they will come and experience the goodness of the Father so tangibly, and that there will be a harvest of souls too! In jesus' name amenn!! 🙌🏼

Would love for u guys to share some of the *happenings in your cgs* so that we can celebrate and be encouraged together! Whether it’s *NCs* who joined in, or people *receiving tongues*, pls holla~ and if there were *testimonies* shared from the cg itself or from the youths in their own day to day, it would be great if we could call it out!! 😝😄

"GUYS my elbow had been *restricted from moving straight* for the last 2 weeks and ive never had it this bad before, and my doc say if this happen means my arthritis getting worse and i just thought to myself i give up alr means my elbow forever bent, but jn Ps prince prayed for elbow movement i tried and it became straighter than it ever was!! Really ptl"

He has arthritis for super long since 2003 and couldn't straighten his elbow but now IT IS WELL. 

His prayer for all of us and our loved ones:
"Guys i wanna pray that there will be a supernatural movement in your life when you choose Jesus, even if your family doesnt believe, just your choosing Him, puts your whole family far above all pain, all medical illness, all cancer, all mind attacks, all depression, all forms of flu, all heart diseases, all joint pain, he sets us apart from all these pains, apart from covid19 and he shall heal all in Jesus’ name!!"

Declaring over every CG and every beloved in this house that healing shall flow to every single person!! in jesus name amenn!!

[29/3/20, 3:05:46 PM] Vanessa: We have a testimony from SA B as well!! 

“Hi, I'm Harron and I had eczema ever since I was little, and it would flare up whenever I ate certain foods or if my surroundings is too hot or too cold. My skin would be dry and itch and when i scratch it, a scab would form. Just a few weeks ago, that happened on my ankle, and immediately when there was a wound, i applied anointing oil and prayed for myself that it would not hurt and it will heal quickly. One week later, I heard about the anointing oil during CG, and my CG prayed for me for supernatural healing of the scab on my ankle. A few days pass and slowly, the scab naturally peeled off and normally, it would hurt, but this time, it didn't to the point I didn't realise the scab is gone. Now, only a small scar is left there and there haven't been any flare ups since :) I pray that whoever sees this that you'll be healed of your sicknesses or diseases, and that whenever you apply the anointing oil, you activate God's blessings on you and you will be supernaturally healed. Amen!”

Believing for even more healings and breakthroughs for every CG! 🙌🏻

That no matter what the arrangement, u are called to be the head and not the tail and the circumstances don’t determine that. But as u shall experience Deut 28: 1-2 

““Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that *the LORD your God will set you high above all* nations of the earth. And all these *blessings shall come upon you and overtake you*, because you obey the voice of the LORD your God:”

Not only are u blessed but u are overtaken with blessings! Keep close to your Shepherd... Fear not little flock, your Shepherd looks out for u 😌🐏🐑🐩🦙

[31/3/20, 1:43:53 PM] ‪+65 9834 6556‬: hi we have a testimony frm tastebuds that was shared during cg last week! hope this blesses & encourages u🤩

“With the recent virus my mom and I have been putting anointing oil on ourselves and we have been praying each time we exit our house that we are protected from the virus. So last Saturday I was at the gym from 11:30 to 12:30 and two days ago we received a message that a woman whose daughter had Covid had entered the gym from 12 o’clock to 1 o’clock therefore I would have been under quarantine and would have been third tier. I got really worried because there was a woman next to me exercising and I thought it was her. But when the gov/club workers went to go review the security footage, I had missed her by 30 minutes because she actually entered the gym at 1 o’clock and not 1230. I just thought it was amazing how I missed her by just 30 minutes."

even as we go on with our daily lives, declaring that there shall be a shield of protection ard us and that only God can orchestrate qarah moments for us and place us in the right place and right time☺️

[1/4/20, 11:49:54 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: HELLO CAREGROUP LEADERS! 

This week is a service week so we're continuing with *CAREGROUP 2.42* and this is how it’ll look like! (in case any of yall are wondering where's Caregroup 1.0, the numbers are referring to Acts 2:42 😲) *We are covering Holy Communion & elements of the Passover in light of upcoming Good Friday* Do take time to talk to your youths about it as well and encourage them to invite their friends:) Over 100k people have been tuning in (and a lot of them have been local) to our Sunday svcs, people need to hear the Good News of Jesus Christ!!! Time for #unprecedentedrevival

Here's a suggested flow for this week~ 

*PART 1: (Fellowship)* - 20 min 
1. Gather your Caregroup in Digital Space! (Set Online Caregroup Culture, appreciate them for prioritising time with the people of God)
_PROTIP: Set up a welcome slide EJ leaders pls share_~
2. Q1: What's something you asked God for this week _esp during 5/10 22_ (fire up the comment section - not everything has to be verbal~)
3. Worship (1-2 songs)

*PART 2: (Apostle's Doctrine)* - 20 min  + 15 min (video) 
1. Read Exodus 12 together! Discuss what they caught. 
2. Right after that, get them to mute themselves and direct them over to the unlisted youtube link to hear the short caregroup message! (We’ll be focusing on HOLY COMMUNION)
_PROTIP: Use Zoom to screen it and watch party together! They can even comment "amen" as they receive (the video is not for circulation 😁)_
_
*PART 3: (Communion & Prayer)* - 30 min
1. Jump back into Digital Space, and talk about it! 
  • Survey: How often do you take Holy Comm in a week? (pls take note of the answers so we can consolidate)
  • What was one thing they caught? 
  • The Passover was the shadow of the Cross to come. The Holy Communion is a reminder of the Jesus's finished work at the cross today. 
  • Encourage them to partake as often as they can & remind one another 
>>> Take Holy Comm together 
>>> Pray together for 10 mins then check in on Tele!!! (type their declarations into the chat box while praying!) 

Some things to consider: 
- Take some extra care to connect with the freshies this week and get them online for CG!
- You don't have to do >2h (it can get a bit draggy online, but breaking out to discuss in smaller online groups helps! Usually when they have the chance to talk among themselves first, it's easier for them to share w the group after~) 
- Use the chatgroup!! More answers, less time (get some of them to elaborate 😊)

[2/4/20, 2:05:26 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: This is the video for this week's CG 2.42! U can refer to the suggested flow in my previous message:) Praying that the Lord causes your own reading of Exodus 12 to bring so much life and light for you first even as we prepare our hearts for the v v significant week of Good Friday up ahead. And believing that out of that shall flow such times of intimacy as you minister to the youths so accurately even online 🤗 Declaring especially that the freshies shall turn up in full force this weekend and have such meaningful convos w their CGs 👶🏻 Do share the good news as it comes!!! 💪🏼😄

[2/4/20, 5:36:09 PM] ‪+65 9855 6180‬: thank u!!! also i just wanted to share a testimony :-) in feb, a newcomer joined the cg but we weren’t sure if she’d accepted Christ -- she would usually reply with “anything”/ go with the flow when i ask her (she used to attend another church with her mom when she was little, but they stopped many years ago) :,-) last sat, i asked the cg for help with making cg slides; she & another youth offered so i created a wa group to tell them that this week’s cg is on the holy comm 🍞🍷 she offered to do this week’s & asked if they had to come up with the slides or if there was a template to follow; i thought it was about the design so i told her it was up to them.... but it turns out she was referring to the cgm so she went to read up on holy comm on the jp website & actually did up her slides HAHAHA (they were really good though :,-)) 🤠 since she said she didn’t know what she was writing, i asked her to ask questions because #doubleportion & she asked if “newbies” like her could partake, after reading that it was only for those who’ve accepted Christ; when i asked her if newbies referred to pre-believers she asked what counted as accepting Christ :,-) so i shared a little & sent her a ss of the salvation prayer on the ncc website & asked if she wanted to accept Christ & she said yes & read the salvation prayer in her room 😭 it’s really crazy because this moment could have been so easily missed — i/ the other youth could have done this week’s slides/ if there weren’t any miscomm she could’ve just done the slides without ever asking these questions & it all happened so quickly & naturally over text :,-)😢 

*tldr:* Jesus is really so good & if a salvation could take place over a short wa convo, imagine how many more salvations & miracles can take place in our online cgs this week!!! ☺❤

Please take note that we are *pushing back the meeting to 8-9.40pm* instead of starting at ~7.30pm~ in case you guys are having dinner with your families (or arranged to take Holy Comm!!) in view of today being the actual day of Passover! 🐑 

Where did that 30 min of prog go? 🤔 We're trusting that the God of ⏳ TIME & SPACE ✨ is on our side!!! We're tightening the prog and we will need u to *watch an announcements video in your own time* to make sure we're all kept up to speed! Please remind each other as there's important info for Good Friday too. #b2bcommunity 

With that please log on on time so that we can cover all that we wanna do together! This virtual cuppage room will be open from 7.50pm so hop on in to standby before 8pm! 🤾🏻‍♂️ https://meet.google.com/sff-mmbx-oxj 🤾🏻‍♀️

*Bring your holy comm, anointing oil, your notebook and your bible* because tonight we're gonna be talking about _shepherding with the skilfulness of hands_ and see the Lord Himself as our shepherd most of all! 🌿

What an awesome weekend we’ve had! The Lord is continuing to move and we’re so proud of y’all for being bold to lead your youths in inviting your own friends! There were a couple of you who even had the privilege to lead people in the salvation prayer over text/recording 🔥 and we give thanks for that!!! 😭

Let’s continue to be diligent to connect with the NBNCs because that’s when we have opportunities to personally connect with them and lead them into relationship with Jesus ☺️ 

*IMPORTANT* 
For *CG 2.42 this Saturday*, we don’t just have a video but, as mentioned during our announcements (please watch this if you haven’t already done so!), also a portion where *your CRs will take the cluster in a combined video party call* 🥳 

Here’s the suggested flow: 
_subject to cluster direction_

*PART 1: (Fellowship & Communion)* - 20 min 
1. Gather CG
2. Brief Life Update 
3. Worship & Holy Comm *_check in w CR if this will be at the combined segment  instead_

*PART 2: (Apostles’ Doctrine)* - 15 min (video) + 30 min (Read the Word)
1. Catch the CG 2.42 video (I AM the Light - reading the word lets Light into our lives) 
2. Read Psalm 119 + Share what they caught 

*PART 3: (Apostles’ Doctrine & Prayer)* - 30 min (Cluster time)
1. CR’s Sharing 
2. Pray for prayer requests (they can type it in the chatbox and CRs may assign youths/ldrs to pray) 

As there are joined parts, do think about breaking out etc so that u can keep to time and coordinate with the other CGs! 

*POST-CG* 
Since we are in the midst of a series, we wanna launch into *reading a chapter of John a day*. We’re hoping to get a digital OTAS sheet like how we did for the series on King David 🤓 *so do encourage/assign youths to read & share on the CG chat in the days following CG 2.42* 😊

There’s no better time for us to dive into the word of God and to let His light in even as we are at home. And we get the privilege to guide our youths in doing so also 🐑 Personally, as I watched the theme of the year video again during this Sunday Service and saw the narrow windows, I just felt the Lord saying, “This is why we are continuing with this series — *I want to continue letting light into My people’s lives*” 📖

[16/4/20, 9:55:37 AM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Hey leaders~ Apologies that the video is still not out -- it was supposed to be done much earlier. But the editors are experiencing strange technical difficulties over the past few days with this particular video tho it's filmed with the usual camera app etc. 🤔 Please keep them in prayer as it finally started working midnight last night and continue to be seated and at rest! 🧘🏻‍♀️🧘🏻‍♂️ Believing that no hindrance and obstacle shall prevent the word from going forth! 

Also, declaring especially over all zee students who are coming into subs, finals etc that the God of Time & Space is on your side. There are no limits to what He can do, and He CAN and WILL save whether by many __fill in your blank__ or by few! 🙌🏻 U are carried on eagles wings where u shall see more and go further than on foot! 👣🦅

Looking forward to hearing the praise reports following this weekend! 👊🏼

[17/4/20, 3:08:15 PM] Berwin ARROW: Hello!! I have some good news :) Over Good Friday, one of my youths told me she had a friend who wanted to be connected to our church because he had been attending a few of our church services online over the past few weekends!

So I texted him and talked to him for a while. And found out that he’s never been to a physical church before (wow!!!!) and that he wants to join arrow. So I asked him if he wanted to receive Jesus and he said yes!

So i texted him the salvation prayer and asked him to voice record himself saying it and send  me back! And HE DID!!!! Jesus is so good 😊

[28/4/20, 12:45:59 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: The app itself is free but this add-on really makes checking the concordance really seamless:)
[28/4/20, 12:48:37 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Get the normal NKJV one first for free (then it should qualify as an add on) 😊
[28/4/20, 1:34:55 PM] ‪+65 8533 0067‬: Hey leaders!! Here's a suggested flow for this week~ 

*PART 1: (Communion & Apostle’s Doctrine)* - 45 min 
1. Gather your Caregroup in Digital Space! (Set Online Caregroup Culture, appreciate them, etc)
2. Worship (1-2 Songs) 🙌🏻
3. Holy Comm 🥖🍷
4. Watch CG2.42: I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD & THE DOOR on the unlisted youtube link to be released (30 min) 🐑🚪
Please note that it’s a longer video this time because both I AMs are tackled together :)

*PART 2: (Fellowship)* - 50 min 
>>> Jump back into Digital Space, and talk! 🗣
  • Life Updates (psst. Check out the “How Are You” hacks)
  • What spoke to them in the message? 

*PART 3: (Prayer)* - 10 min 
>>> Take time to pray over areas of concern & over our nation 🗡

*BONUS*
Get the youths excited for a *special May Holiyay weekend programmes*~ We’ve never crossed this way before and we’re gonna make it count! We can just share that we’re planning some special stuff (it’ll likely be about 3 hours on Saturdays so it won’t require their whole day), and they can expect more details to come 😊 *(We will be giving JC leadership updates ASAP, please save 6 May 2020, Wednesday, 7.30pm-9.30pm for now.)*

*Some things to consider:* 
- We’re generally holding the service timing, but if needed you can consider start CG at 4pm so you can release them in time for dinner! 🍽

- Take some extra care to connect with the freshies this week and get them online for CG! 🐑🏃🏻‍♂️

Praying that this CG shall be full of life and hope and that as you guys prepare for it, it shall be easy and light (esp for those revising for finals/prepping subs) that you shall be so refreshed yourselves!!! 🌊🌊🌊

If you lose this info, refer to this tinyurl.com/jc242info (also in our whatsapp description) 😊

[28/4/20, 9:53:32 PM] Berwin ARROW: basically what this concordance is like:
BLB on steroids!! 

- so like you can check the greek/hebrew original words, just by mousing over the desired word.

- and you can check all the interlinear cross-references :)

if you're interested to get it, its currently $21.99, it's normally like $45! so more than 50% off. don't use the ios/windows app to look for the concordance, instead purchase it directly from the website here:
https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=21141

*ps you need to download the app, and download the normal NKJV first, to get the promo price!
[28/4/20, 10:00:13 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: Yay!! Thanks for sharing the tip and glad it works!!
[30/4/20, 1:21:50 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: HEY ATEAM! We are in an unprecedented time and season but I believe that there is unprecedented grace for all of us!!! We have a really special mission ahead of us!!! 

*Ps Dan's heart is to connect w the JC leaders this Sat from 2-3pm.* If u really can't make it (exam slot etc) please just let ur CRs know but among those of us who are available *let's rally together*. 💪🏼😊 There are upcoming camp updates in a leaders pack by this week but with the timeline being so short let's trust God that this will be a season where we run together united and move things ONWARDS:) (especially for this month and we shall reap the fruit from then onwards too 🙆‍♀️😄)

We'll be holding the 6 May 7.30-9.30pm that we choped earlier this week in case we are unable to cover all the updates, if we are we will release it so stay tuned 😊  For those who are working on finals & subs, speaking such clarity of mind and length of days to u guys!!! 

_"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, *yet not I, but the grace of God [WHO is] with me*."_

We wanna give weight to what our under-shepherd is speaking by the Spirit of God, so let's lean in and get our youths to tune in as well! We never lose out when we come together and hear what is on God's heart for us especially in times like these ✨

_As we had initially given the direction for this weekend to be a fun cg, you guys can still go ahead to plan some activities (it's the hols after all!!) around this service streaming before/after factoring in the youths dinner w fam~ The recording is still being edited so the exact duration is TBC, but it should be shorter than 2h all in._ 😊 Thanks so much, we appreciate each and everyone of u for making the necessary adjustments 🙆🏻‍♀️ believing that this shall be a _divine_ disruption ⚡ See u guys tonight! 🔥

This will help us lots with what's to come 💪🏼😁

On another side note, what an awesome time we spent feeding on the word last night. Hope you're looking forward to the next one!! There's a sharing point I would like you guys to think about and share in your cluster chats this week on top of the reading plan (those who hung around last night will be helping to cascade this 🙌🏻) *I believe that the Lord will truly show us the breakthroughs He has prepared for us first in the spirit and then our eyes shall see it by the time May is over!!!* 🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♂️

[11/5/20, 12:00:33 PM] ‪+65 8366 7362‬: Hello JC Leaders !! *This is regarding POP Masterclasses*

For Arrow this week, we’re gonna do something different! We’re gonna break out into different streams to talk about the areas we we wanna possess our possessions in — whether it’s Family & Salvations among our loved ones, good success in our Studies or in National Service, or in our Friendships — be expectant that God is gonna speak straight to the heart through these sessions and as we receive His promises for these areas and practical handles to reign in these spaces, we will POP right through whatever we feel stuck in and experience our breakthroughs! And if you know a friend who would be blessed by any of these sessions, invite them to join us! It’s gonna be a blast! 

Quick Tips: 
- Choose ONE stream to go for
- Dapao back for your cg where everyone can share what they caught from the stream they attended (post-session) 
- Indicate your interest here for priority admission: tinyurl.com/jcmasters2020 (you can enter at 3.50pm, for those without priority they’ll be allowed in based on availability from 3.55pm onwards)
- Ensure your name convention is *NAME & SURNAME (CLUSTER, CG)* when entering the masterclass so we can let you in smoothly!

We’ve posted something on the telechannel too regarding POP !! :-))

[11/5/20, 5:17:52 PM] ‪+65 9732 7701‬: Hi guys! Just wanted to share about something that spoke to me while going through the open jio bible study questions ☺️ 

I think 1 qn that rly got me thinking was why Moses changed Joshua’s name from Hosea to Joshua! I guess its just a detail that I never really questioned since the bible doesnt draw a lot of attention to it either. But how I saw it’s significance was through the change in definition of the names. Since Hoshea=salvation (deliverance) & Joshua=Jehovah is salvation, the change was a constant reminder to Joshua of who’s in-charge. That while Joshua would go on to fight kings+giants and conquer land, he would remember that his success came from the Lord alone. Jehovah IS salvation. Which is such a liberating reminder 😭 that the pressure of deliverance was not on his efforts of fighting longer/harder/better but that the Lord will fight for him against his enemies.

Today since we don’t have people changing our names halfway through our lives (LOL), lets remind each other constantly that the Lord has gone ahead and won our battles -> we no longer have to strive for victory cause its already ours🥳
[11/5/20, 5:21:05 PM] ‪+65 9871 7017‬: WOOO AMEN SARAH !!

[12/5/20, 12:22:23 PM] Megan ARROW: Hii just wanna share smth I caught from the bible study qns as well

One of the questions given was why did the Lord ask Moses to send the spies into the promised land, like why not just tell them to go in straight and give the land to them? I saw it as the Lord wanting to show them that He'll be faithful to bring them in, just like how He was faithful in bringing them out of Egypt! The Lord wanted to show the spies that it wont be by their efforts or strength that they can enter the promise land, in a way bringing them back to the beginning when getting delivered out of Egypt was not by their efforts either, and was the Lord's doing and at the end of it all, He would still be faithful! He was faithful and will always be faithful!! 🙌🏻✨

And with reference to Deuteronomy 1:22-23, actl I got a little confused when I first read it but after confirming with Darren (thanks Darren!!) like the Lord met the people at their faith level. Maybe the ppl were a bit unsure about whether they could go into the land hence the suggestion of sending ppl to scout the land but the Lord met them where they were at, and was like 'Okay, if sending the scouts in would ease some of your fears, we will do that' then He made the suggestion about sending one from each tribe! So the Lord really loved the people and really wanted them not to enter the land with any fear in their hearts and this really shows us the goodness of the Lord!! :")

[12/5/20, 1:09:16 PM] Vanessa: Whew Megan Ang!! Amen!!🔥🔥🔥
[12/5/20, 1:14:00 PM] Deborah Chia ARROW: awesome:)) i love how the Lord actually wanted them to see His goodness!! (although sometimes we focus on the wrong things... 😅 but He still loves us and He is still faithful!! And even more so now under grace, just like how when Peter lost sight of God and looked at his giants instead -- wind & waves -- that was when Jesus grabbed him by the hand and lifted him up!)
[12/5/20, 1:16:00 PM] ‪+65 9109 5574‬: Amen!! Rly like the part about God meeting us at our faith level :))

[13/5/20, 9:22:23 AM] ‪+65 8299 5979‬: Last week, ps Dan shared about how we can catch the spirit of joshua and caleb as we spend the next few weeks preparing for camp! initially, I was in awe of how much faith they had to be set apart from the rest and see what God sees (but I related more to the 10 spies). I wondered how they had possessed the inheritance in their hearts even before going up to possess the land - and how do I approach my giants?

However when ps Dan shared about how the spirit they possessed was because they had a personal relationship with the Lord, simply knowing He delighted in them - just as how Jesus did everything conscious of His Father's love for Him! each new day, we get to hold a magnifying glass to concentrate and personalise His love for us - "..the Son of God, who *loved me*, and gave Himself *for me*."

just wanted to remind you guys that to approach our giants, we first possess our "belovedness". It's not on our ability to slay the giants ahead of us but to just hear Him whisper His love secrets to us XOXO

[14/5/20, 11:10:39 AM] ‪+65 9061 7108‬: hello so darren made me share something i caught from last week 😤

after the zoom bible study in the breakout room, darren mentioned how we don't know the size of the pomegranates & figs, bUT THE GRAPES 🍇 brought from the promised land were sO HUGE that they needed 2 people to carry them in. 🚶🏻‍♂️🍇🚶🏻‍♂️

and this was a picture of how in the promised land, there are fruits that we can immediately partake of, but there is a greater degree of fruits that we can partake of _in community_. when there is someone standing back 2 back w u, someone 💪 *taking ground* 💪 w you, you can bring back an _eNTIRE POLE_. there are some fruits where it takes a plurality to receive. 👯‍♀️👯‍♂️

p.s. hebron means to unite, to bind together in fellowship - another picture of what taking the promised land looks like ✨

and i think this really encouraged me and reminded me of how we're truly #bettertogether🤞 ? and how the Lord never ties us to people to weigh us down, He always places us in community so we can receive a greater portion 🙌🍇🍇 and idk it just got me excited again and reminded me of The Point of why we do things together, and i thought that was p cool ❄️ praying this blesses ya'll 2day! not to take for granted the people the Lord has gifted us with in this season ✌️
[14/5/20, 11:11:39 AM] ‪+65 8328 4325‬: YESSSS amen to community!!!
