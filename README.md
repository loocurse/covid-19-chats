# covid-19-chats
## Motivation
Sitting around during COVID-19, I felt like everything was moving in slow motion - time passed slower, projects got delayed and 
people just chilled. I wasn't sure whether that was just my experience or if it truly is a phenomenon all my friends were experiencing. Therefore I decided to test that hypothesis to check if people were replying messages slower.

## Dataset
I used my exported whatsapp chats and analysed my teams.
